        "text": "Maternity wards on alert for Cleveland cop's wife accused of faking pregnancy, cancer Area maternity wards on alert for Cleveland cop's wife accused of faking pregnancy, cancer Brandon Simmons, Phil Trexler and Lisa Lowry, WKYC 11:51 PM. EST February 08, 2018 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nCleveland police are warning area hospitals of a woman they say may be attempting to abduct a newborn child. \nThis same woman, Dawn Brown, and her husband, Cleveland police Officer Ken Brown, are under investigation for making claims that Dawn Brown is pregnant and has terminal cancer. Police do not believe the woman was pregnant nor ill. \nShe has also been the target of online social media scorn from cancer survivors and others who have supported her. \nThe investigation comes after a Jan. 14 \"Blood Drive\" fundraiser held at the Cleveland Police Patrolman's Association (CPPA) hall. \nThe officer abruptly retired Wednesday, a police spokeswoman said. Ken Brown had been assigned to the department's Gang Impact Unit. \nThe flyer for the drive states “Officer Ken Brown and his wife Dawn are expecting their beautiful baby girl Kassidy next month.” Other drives, showers and fundraisers were held in 2017, including one in Vermilion. \nBut it turns Dawn Brown may not be pregnant or physically sick. \nCleveland Clinic’s Fairview Hospital on Wednesday issued a warning to employees about Brown’s “ongoing scam” involving a fake pregnancy. The warning stems from the Cleveland Police Department investigation. \nIt also warns employees that investigators are “concerned that Brown could attempt to try and take a baby from the hospital.” \nCleveland Clinic followed on Thursday with a statement saying: “Based on information we received from the Cleveland Police Department, we have taken extra measures to ensure patients are safe and secure at Fairview Hospital. We take this matter seriously and want to reassure our patients that their safety is our top priority.” \nChannel 3 News first reported the allegations and has since looked into Dawn Brown’s history. She’s made claims of being pregnant with cancer before, and a woman matching her name and description was suspected of scouting local hospital maternity wards in 2001. \nKen Brown had been off-duty for an job-related injury prior to his sudden retirement. He is still being investigated internally. \nA story chronicling Dawn’s history was posted to fightlikeagirlclub.com ( https://www.fightlikeagirlclub.com/dawns-fight-like-a-girl-story-breast-cancer-2/ ) \nIn the November 6th post, Dawn Brown wrote that she’s been battling cancer since she was 16-years-old. She’s now 44-years-old and on her fourth pregnancy. She made claims of speaking in Washington D.C. and garnering support from President Trump and Vice President Pence. \nAt that time, she said she was 26 weeks pregnant and expected to deliver her child on December 15, 2017. The blood drive held for Ken and Dawn by the CPPA was held on January 14, 2018. She has not delivered a baby during that time. \nChannel 3 News located a new baby registry for Ken and Dawn Brown with a Jan. 22, 2018 due date. Many of the items show they’ve already been purchased. \nDawn Brown made similar pregnancy claims in 2016, telling supporters in October of that year that she was carrying twins due on Dec. 15. She later posted that cancer claimed the lives on the unborn children. \nA quick review of Dawn’s history shows her marriage to Ken is at least her 6th, according to court records. They met while shopping for toilet paper at a local Walmart. \nThree divorce cases paint allegations of financial grabs and marital discord. \nOne marriage ended back in 2000, with a court order requiring Dawn be “restrained from abusing, harassing, threatening, molesting and/or striking” her then-husband. \nAnother 2001 divorce proceeding ended with Dawn Brown being ordered to return a baby furniture set and other items to a different husband. \nFinally, a 2005 divorce case shows all issues were resolved after Dawn ended efforts to collect from that husband’s pension or retirement plan. \nChannel 3 News has made several attempts to speak with Dawn Brown to validate her claims of cancer and pregnancy. She hasn’t responded. Her Facebook account has also been removed. \nA friend of Dawn’s refused an on-camera interview, but says she believes her pregnancy claims are true. She “felt the baby kick.” She couldn’t provide an explanation for Dawn not coming forward with proof. \nCleveland Police issued the following statement about the Brown case on Thursday afternoon: \n“The Cleveland Division of Police is currently investigating a complaint of possible fraud being conducted by the wife of a Cleveland Police Officer. The female is suspected of making fraudulent claims regarding her medical condition(s). She is also suspected to have solicited donations via social media with online campaigns. Investigators are still gathering evidence pertaining to the female’s medical records. The Police Officer associated with the case, Kenneth Brown (husband) retired as of February 7, 2018. Area hospitals have issued statements to their employees and patients to be aware of her presence in order to ensure that their patients are safe. Charges have not been filed in this case. The investigation remains ongoing.” ",

        "text": "Donors urged to help the Red Cross maintain blood supply Submitted by the American Red Cross Feb 7, 2018 Save \nWinter storms and the flu don’t just mean a lot of people are missing work and school — it also means they can’t keep their American Red Cross blood donation appointments. The Red Cross is urging healthy donors of all blood types to roll up a sleeve to help maintain the blood supply for patients in need. \nIn 2018, severe winter weather forced about 600 blood drives to cancel, resulting in more than 17,500 uncollected blood and platelet donations. And, widespread flu across the U.S. has resulted in lower turnout at blood drives. \nBlood donations are needed in the coming days to help replenish the blood supply and ensure patients continue to receive lifesaving treatments. Donors can help even more patients when they invite a loved one, friend or co-worker to give with them. \nMake an appointment to donate this winter by downloading the free Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). \nUpcoming blood donation opportunities in Ohio for Feb. 16-28 \nJackson \nFeb. 16: 8:30 a.m. — 2 p.m., Jackson High School, 500 Vaughn Street \nFeb. 22: 1 p.m. — 5:30 p.m., First Church of the Nazarene, 251 Powell Drive \nFeb. 23: 12:30 p.m. — 5 p.m., Jackson Holzer Med Ctr, 500 Burlington Road \nWellston \nFeb. 20: 1:30 p.m. — 6 p.m., Hope United Methodist Church, 219 East 1st Street \nLawrence \nFeb. 22: 10 a.m. — 3:30 p.m., Ohio University Riffe Center, 1804 Liberty Avenue \nMeigs \nFeb. 21: 1:30 p.m. — 7 p.m., Meigs Primary School, 36871 State Rt. 124 \nPomeroy \nFeb. 21: 1 p.m. — 6 p.m., Mulberry Community Center, 260 Mulberry Ave \nRacine \nFeb. 22: 9 a.m. — 2 p.m., Southern Local HS — Gym, 920 Elm Street \nPike \nFeb. 26: 9 a.m. — 2:30 p.m., Waverly High School, 1 Tiger Drive \nScioto \nFeb. 27: 12 p.m. — 5:30 p.m., All Saints Episcopal Church, 610 4th Street \nWheelersburg \nFeb. 28: 8 a.m. — 1:30 p.m., Wheelersburg High School, 800 Pirate Drive \nWashington \nFeb. 20: 11 a.m. — 4 p.m., Belpre Medical Campus-Marietta Memorial Hospital, 807 Farson Street \nHow to donate blood \nSimply download the American Red Cross Blood Donor App, visit redcrossblood.org or call 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) to make an appointment or for more information. All blood types are needed to ensure a reliable supply for patients. A blood donor card or driver’s license or two other forms of identification are required at check-in. Individuals who are 17 years of age in most states (16 with parental consent where allowed by state law), weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health may be eligible to donate blood. High school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also have to meet certain height and weight requirements. \nBlood and platelet donors can save time at their next donation by using RapidPass® to complete their pre-donation reading and health history questionnaire online, on the day of their donation, before arriving at the blood drive. To get started, follow the instructions at redcrossblood.org/RapidPass or use the Blood Donor App. \nVolunteers needed \nAnother way to support the lifesaving mission of the American Red Cross is to become a volunteer transportation specialist and deliver lifesaving blood products to local area hospitals. Volunteer transportation specialists play a very important role in ensuring an ample blood supply for patients in need by transporting blood and blood products. For more information and to apply for a volunteer transportation specialist position, visit rdcrss.org/driver . \nThe American Red Cross shelters, feeds and provides emotional support to victims of disasters; supplies about 40 percent of the nation’s blood; teaches skills that save lives; provides international humanitarian aid; and supports military members and their families. The Red Cross is a not-for-profit organization that depends on volunteers and the generosity of the American public to perform its mission.

        "text": "Preserving fertility in women with cancer  43 PM IST \nNew Delhi: Many cancer treatments affect the ability to become pregnant, temporarily or permanently. \nFertility preservation (FP) is an effort to retain the fertility of cancer patients, thereby improving their quality of life. \n“Due to the tremendous rise in risk of cancer, it becomes essential to opt for preserving fertility. After the cancer treatment, a woman’s body might recover naturally and produce mature eggs that can be fertilized. However, the medical team may recommend waiting for six months to two years before trying to get pregnant. The length of time depends on the type of cancer and the treatment used,” said Dr. Priti Gupta Fertility & IVF Expert, First Step IVF Clinic, New Delhi. \nFertility Preservation Options: \n-Egg freezing \nEgg freezing is a well known method of preserving fertility in women. It might be a good choice for women who do not have a partner. For egg freezing, mature eggs are removed and frozen. Once the woman is ready to become pregnant, the eggs can be thawed, fertilized, and implanted in her uterus. \nA new method of freezing called vitrification has made egg freezing more efficient and successful. Another alternative could be to freeze half the eggs and fertilize the rest with sperm from a donor and then freeze embryos. \n-Embryo freezing \nThis is the most established and successful method of preserving a woman’s fertility. Mature eggs are removed from a woman’s ovaries and fertilized in the lab. This is called in-vitro fertilization (IVF). \nThousands of sperm are put in a sterile dish with each egg. Sometimes one sperm is injected into each egg .The embryos are then frozen to be used after cancer treatment. A woman will have a better chance of a successful pregnancy if several embryos are stored. \n“For women who are less than 35, a single embryo transfer is the safest way of using IVF to get pregnant so as to avoid multiple pregnancies,” said Gupta. \n-Ovarian tissue freezing \nThis process involves removal of all or part of one ovary by laparoscopy. The ovarian tissue is usually cut into small strips, frozen, and stored. Ovarian tissue freezing lets women freeze a vastly larger number of immature eggs for future use. When frozen ovarian tissue is re-implanted into the body and regains its functions, immature frozen eggs within the tissue start developing normally. \nPost cancer treatment, the ovarian tissue is placed in the pelvis. Once the transplanted tissue starts to function again, the eggs can be collected and fertilized. The ovarian tissue does take blood supply and she is to produce hormones after its transplanted. \n-For women who are not fertile after cancer treatment \nDonor egg is an option for women who have a healthy uterus but do not have any eggs. Egg donation is often a successful treatment for women who can no longer produce healthy eggs. \nAlso, any woman who has a healthy uterus can maintain a pregnancy by the utilizing the donor embryos.

        "text": "@BeckyMurphyEDP 09 February, 2018 - 06:30 Archie Ramshaw with his mum Theresa and dad Craig. The family are raising money to help fund them during a Archie's bone marrow transplant. Byline: Sonya Duncan Copyright: Archant 2018 Archant 2017 For the past seven years teenager Archie Ramshaw has been battling an extremely rare blood disorder which has seen him have more than 150 blood transfusions. Reporter Rebecca Murphy spoke to his family as they prepare for the next stage of his journey. \n  Archie Ramshaw with his mum Theresa and dad Craig. The family are raising money to help fund them during a Archie's bone marrow transplant. Byline: Sonya Duncan Copyright: Archant 2018 \nIn October 2010, the life of Archie Ramshaw changed forever. \nThen aged just seven, Archie was diagnosed with a rare form of anaemia known as Congenital Sideroblastic Anaemia. \nThe condition means Archie’s bone marrow is unable to produce healthy blood cells. Sideroblastic Anaemia stops Archie’s body transferring the iron in his blood into haemoglobin, which red cells need to transport oxygen efficiently. \nNow aged 14, the teenager, who lives in Swaffham with his older brother Harry and mother and father Theresa and Craig, has had more than 150 blood transfusions and takes 11 tablets a day. Archie Ramshaw aged 9 turning on the Christmas lights at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn in 2012. Picture: Ian Burt \nThe transfusions have resulted in him contracting several blood and bone marrow viruses and he has had to have his spleen removed. \nThe teenager is now starting to build up a resistance to the transfusions and they have left his organs riddled with iron. He has to have a needle inserted into his stomach for 10 hours a day to remove the excess iron from his body. \nMrs Ramshaw said the only way forward for Archie is a bone marrow transplant, which will replace the damaged blood cells with healthy ones. \nShe said: “There is no other option. If we carried on the way we are he would not make it to his adult years. It could be really good or it could not be good and something we don’t want to think about. If it does not work and Archie is still here, we don’t know what is next.” Archie Ramshaw with his mum Theresa and dad Craig. The family are raising money to help fund them during a Archie's bone marrow transplant. Byline: Sonya Duncan Copyright: Archant 2018 \nMr Ramshaw added: “There are big risks with the surgery. The whole bone marrow transplant is another journey. Hopefully when we come out of the other side of this we can focus on where he wants to be.” \nArchie’s transplant is set to take place at St Mary’s Hospital in London this year. \nHe will spend part of that time in isolation and could be in hospital for a number of months. Recovery could take up to a year. \nMr Ramshaw, an IT project manager, said the transplant will be “ugly”. \n“He will end up with sores in his mouth and he will lose his hair,” he said. “The side effects from having this aggressive chemotherapy will be awful. And there will be the added complication of the liver fibrosis which will make it even more risky.” \nThe couple said Archie is starting to get “fed up” with trying to manage the illness along with the pain, side effects and school. \n“Up until a few weeks ago he was happy and smiley but he is just fed up,” said Mrs Ramshaw, who is a community healthcare assistant and is also studying for a nursing degree. \n“He sees all his hospital friends coming into hospital and going out. You also see the other people who come in for a transplant and don’t come out. Archie has witnessed all of this so he must be terrified.” \nThe couple said they hope after the transplant that the Nicholas Hamond Academy pupil can carry on as a “relatively normal teenager” and get back to enjoying football and going out with his friends. \n“We hope that once he has had the transplant he will not have to have blood transfusions. We are hoping that he will not have to have the needle into his stomach for 10 hours every night,” said Mr Ramshaw. \n“We are hoping he will not have to take the copious amounts of medication on a daily basis just to manage the side effects of the treatment he is having to manage the illness that he has got.” \nThe family have worked out it will cost around £8,000 to fund travelling, parking, hotels and food over a six month period while Archie is in hospital. \nTo help towards the expenses the family have started a fundraising page and so far nearly £5,000 has been raised. \nMr Ramshaw said: “My primary focus is to ensure that we fund as much as possible for all the additional costs throughout the transplant so that we can spend time with Archie, by his bed, where he needs us, without having to worry and stress about finances.” \nMrs Ramshaw added: “The support we have had has just been fantastic. I cannot believe how big it has got. My main aim was to bring awareness and if we got donation then that would be amazing.” \nTo donate visit the Ramshaw’s fundraising page more information about Archie and his journey can be found on his website or Archie’s Bone Marrow Transplant on Facebook.",

        "text": "twitter TWEET Neal Kyle and his daughter Merinda present $10,500, raised by the upper Macleay community, to Mid North Coast Cancer Institute Nursing Unit Manager Jenny Baroutis. \nThe daughter of a cattle farmer from Millbank west of Kempsey has inspired her community to support the Mid North Coast Cancer Institute at Port Macquarie. \nWhen Merinda Kyle found out her dad Neal, a patient at the cancer unit, was in remission she wanted the doctors and nurses to know how thankful she was. \nThe hotel raised more than $10,000 \nThe 18-year-old former Kempsey High Captain decided on a “spring snip” at the Willawarrin Hotel in a bid to raise funds. \nHer trademark dark hair, long enough to sit on, received the chop and in return a packed house at the hotel raised a massive $10,500. \n“I was just so relieved when I heard dad was getting better, I wanted to do something to give back. All the nurses in the treatment room, and Dr (Stephen) Begbie, were wonderful. \n“I had never had short hair in my life and thought losing it was a small sacrifice to make if we were going to fundraise for this fantastic, local cancer service. \n“Everyone came on board... so many people, including small businesses, in the Macleay helped out with raffle prizes. We even had three steers go to market and the stock and station agent waived his fee, and another steer was auctioned at the pub on the night. \nRelated: Lilli Pilli ladies support cancer patients \n“A lot of people helped, too many to name, but I really want to thank Maree Tyne and Maudie Reid who helped organise the event and the Willawarrin Hotel for hosting it.” \nProud father Neal Kyle also thanked his community for getting behind the fundraiser and urged everyone to be vigilant with their check-ups and blood tests. \n“I was one of these blokes who thought there was no need for check-ups - I won’t get cancer. The Willawarrin Hotel \n“Well, that wasn’t what happened early in 2017. I’m just thankful I have wonderful kids and had a fantastic team at the cancer unit taking care of me.” \nNurse Unit Manager Jenny Baroutis thanked the upper Macleay community for their support. \n“We are all touched by the tremendous generosity of such a small community,” Ms Baroutis said. \n“This donation will directly benefit locals who are receiving cancer treatment at their local cancer unit. \nThe Mid North Coast Cancer Institute’s Clinical Trials Unit at Port Macquarie is a service designed to streamline cancer clinical trials undertaken across the Mid North Coast Local Health District. \nIn so doing, the office is able to provide more than 60 oncology clinical trials to local residents. Ms Baroutis said Clinical Research is the foundation on which clinical medicine is practised.",

        "text": "Just over five weeks ago, Oprah Winfrey, arguably the world's most adored African-American woman, delivered a speech for the ages at the 2018 Golden Globes. In accepting the Cecil B. DeMille award for outstanding contribution to entertainment, Winfrey managed to do three things at once. She captured perfectly the deep-rooted inequalities at the heart not just of the entertainment industry, but across all industries, blue-collar and white-. She sparked wild speculation regarding her own presidential ambitions. And, perhaps, most importantly, she delivered a rousing message of hope to young women and girls everywhere in the face of sexual abuse and marauding male power.\n\"I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon,\" she told her star-studded audience, most of whom were dressed in black to support the Time's Up campaign, aimed at ending sexual harassment and gender disparity.\n\"And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women … and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say 'me too' again.\"\nShe added, \"For too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up.\"\nThis moment, this great reckoning in history, didn't just happen. It took the elevation of a sexual predator – a self-confessed \"pussy\" grabber – to the leadership of the free world to galvanise millions of women. It took great reporting, first from The New York Times and then The New Yorker magazine , to reveal a shocking litany of sexual abuse by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, one of the giants of Hollywood. And, of course, it took the lightning speed of the information revolution to enable millions of women to finally share their often traumatised sexual histories, creating a deafening roar – and ricocheting effect – around the world. Every day a new name, another industry, another once-darkened corridor of power exposed to the blinding light of disgrace.\nAfter the forensic takedown of Weinstein, it was actor Kevin Spacey 's turn to be outed (in his case for alleged sexual misconduct towards boys and young men), then comedian and producer Louis C.K. , then television hosts Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer ; then dozens of other prominent men in the arts and entertainment: actors, playwrights, producers, editorial directors, chief executives, studio heads, fashion photographers, editors, publishers, journalists.\nAdvertisement From the American entertainment industry it tripped the wire into state legislatures; then on to national politics, with congressmen from Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota and, in the case of Alabama, the egregious would-be Republican senator Roy Moore, all caught up in the widening scandal. (And we've only just begun talking properly about restaurant and automotive industry employees, nurses, farm workers, domestic workers and hotel attendants. In Chicago recently, female members of the local union were granted the right to install \"panic buttons\" on their uniforms because, apparently, bending over to clean a bath, or turn down the sheets, has always been a hazardous occupation.)\nFrom the United States, it then crossed the Atlantic to Britain, where a dozen MPs were accused of unwanted sexual behaviour, and the ruling Conservative Party's Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was forced to resign. Then back to the US and on to Silicon Valley and sports, where the long-time women's gymnastics physician, Larry Nassar, was awaiting final sentencing for his sickening behaviour with more than 150 women and girls, all on the pretext of medical treatment. (He would be sent to prison for up to 175 years.)\nMillions of women worldwide were sharing stories of mistreatment, via the Twitter hashtag #MeToo , in what was being described as a \"watershed\", a \"tipping point\", a \"karmic earthquake\". Or, as Jacqueline Maley would label the growing list of perpetrators in The Sydney Morning Herald , the \"Oh god. Not you too?\" phenomenon .\nIn France, where an estimated 225,000 women were victims of violence in 2016, social networks began overflowing with accounts of sexual harassment and assault, often carrying the hashtag #BalanceTonPorc, meaning \"Expose Your Pig\". Speaking in late November on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, President Emmanuel Macron described French society as \"sick with sexism\", before calling for a minute's silence for the 123 women – one every three days – killed during 2016. (The backlash – and furious counter-backlash – came less than two months later when nearly 100 prominent French women, including actor Catherine Deneuve, denounced the #MeToo campaign in a letter describing it as a \"witchhunt against men\" and a sign that Anglo-American \"puritanism\" had gone too far. Deneuve later distanced herself from some of her more extreme co-signatories.)\nHere, journalist and Fairfax contributor Tracey Spicer sent a tweet to her nearly 50,000 followers asking about sexual harassment in the Australian media and entertainment industries. She was overwhelmed by allegations from more than 500 women, and the names of 65 men. (That figure now stands at 1000 women and 100 men.) As we all know, celebrity gardener Don Burke emerged as undisputed leader of the pack, after which claims against actor Craig McLachlan surfaced.\nAt the time of writing, more names were about to be revealed and hundreds of women in the music industry had joined the #MeNoMore movement to highlight direct experiences of rape, harassment and assault. Melbourne's Lord Mayor Robert Doyle had also taken leave of absence following allegations of sexual harassment and indecent assault; while universities across the country were still dealing with a 2016 report from the Australian Human Rights Commission showing 21 per cent of students, the vast majority of them women, had experienced some form of sexual harassment in a university setting.\nPerhaps it takes a moment like this in history for men to truly wake up.\n\"Do you hear the rumble?\" asked Wendy Squires in a Sydney Morning Herald column crackling with fury, shortly after the Weinstein allegations lit a global bonfire. \"Can you smell the fear?\" And then, \"It's time for men in media to know what it feels like to be watched and judged and to have their careers put in jeopardy as a result. It's time they are afraid, just like we women have been our entire careers … This avalanche has not reached a stop yet. Nope, it's going to continue to roll and gather momentum and I predict many will be caught in its destructive wake. Good luck [men] – you'll need it.\"\nThis is a treacherous path for any writer to try to navigate, especially a straight, middle-aged male in a gender-fraught – and gender-fluid – world. Every brief utterance is – how shall I put this – cocked and loaded; every assertion open to furious rebuttal. I remember at a party two years ago meeting a lesbian couple who happened to be midstream talking about … cunts. I introduced myself and offered the view that I was struck by how the worst word in the English language was a reference to the most sacred part of a woman's body.\n\"Listen mate,\" one of them retorted. \"I've been with hundreds of cunts in my life and none of them was sacred.\"\nSo it's complicated, right? Yet I continue to grapple with the way language often denigrates women. A \"cunt\" – when uttered by a heterosexual male – is typically the most contemptible person one can meet. The pudendum – or woman's vulva – originates from the Latin word pudere , meaning \"to be ashamed\". Vagina derives from the 17th century, and is a Latin word meaning \"sheath\" or \"scabbard\". (Presumably where a man puts his sword.) Older women are often dubbed \"hags\", \"crones\" and \"witches\". \" Schamlippen \" is a common German slang word for the vulva, translating to \"lips of shame\".\nThis shame is real and ever-present, according to Tony Award-winning American playwright Eve Ensler, author of The Vagina Monologues, a global phenomenon of the late 1990s.\n\"Twenty years ago, no one said the word 'vagina',\" she tells Good Weekend. \"You couldn't say it anywhere. I always make a joke that you can put plutonium on the front pages of newspapers, or Scud missiles, or radiation, or death, but if you say vagina everyone goes into hysterics.\n\"That tells us everything we need to know about the world. The place where most of us come from … the majority of human beings on the planet have passed through the vagina.\"\nEnsler's journey across the global landscape of female suffering and indignity is highly instructive in trying to grasp what is happening today. In 1996, The Vagina Monologues – a 90-minute distillation of more than 200 women exploring their femininity – was performed for the first time, and by 1998 had been showcased from Islamabad to London, Oklahoma to Jerusalem. In 2001, in New York's Madison Square Garden, actor Jane Fonda simulated giving birth on stage, while fellow actor Glenn Close repeatedly shouted the word \"cunt\" to 18,000 women, followed by the collective orgasmic moaning of the Vulva Choir.\nEnsler's \"monologues\" captured stories of menstruation, menopause and mutilation; of date rape, gang rape, incest and shame; of women with black eyes and broken bones; of women humiliated and violated and left mute and homeless in their own bodies.\nJane Fonda, Eve Ensler and Glenn Close on stage during a performance of The Vagina Monologues in New York. Photo: Getty Images\nIn the US-Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez, Ensler later learnt of 400 women who had disappeared over the previous decade, 370 of them murdered, ravaged and disfigured. \"These women,\" she wrote, \"had become as disposable as empty Coca-Cola cans. Sometimes their bones turned up next to old bottles in parking lots. Sometimes they were blamed for being mutilated and tortured because of what they'd been wearing. They were rapidly becoming an endangered species.\"\nDuring the Bosnian war of the early 1990s, \"rape camps\" were set up by Serbian paramilitary units where up to 50,000 mostly Muslim women were herded into enclosures and preyed on around the clock, week in, week out.\nOften they were only released when they were pregnant, or their bellies had been torn open first. Gang rapes. Public rapes. Rape as an instrument of terror. Rape in the service of ethnic cleansing. Rape of mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, girls as young as 12. Women with their vaginas destroyed, as Ensler so chillingly captured in one of her monologues, My Vagina Was My Village :\nMy vagina. A live wet water village. They invaded it. Butchered it and burned it down. I do not touch now. Do not visit. I live someplace else now. I don't know where that is.\nIt might be tempting to see this brutality as a malignancy that only obliterates women and girls far from our privileged shores. The sex trafficking of young girls in South-East Asia has nothing to do with us, nor bride and widow burning in India, nor the dousing of women and girls with kerosene and being set alight in Pakistan. In their international bestselling book, Half the Sky: How to Change the World , published in 2009, New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof and his wife Sheryl WuDunn described how a beautiful 17-year-old Kurdish girl in northern Iraq, Du'a Aswad, was accused – without proof – of sleeping with a Sunni Arab boy with whom she'd fallen in love. The young woman was dragged into the street by eight men, as a large crowd gathered around her.\n\"At least 1000 men joined in the assault,\" they wrote. \"So many men in the crowd shot video clips with their cell phones that on the web you can find a half-dozen versions of what happened next.\n\"Du'a was thrown to the ground, and her black skirt was ripped off to humiliate her. She tried to get up, but they kicked her around as if she were a soccer ball. Frantic, she tried to fend off the blows, to get up, to cover herself, to find a sympathetic face in the crowd. Then the men gathered rocks and concrete blocks and dropped them on her. It took 30 minutes for Du'a to die.\"\nIt's tempting to see this and other \"honour\" killings, as well as the genital mutilation of girls in Africa and the Middle East, as peripheral to what has erupted since Harvey Weinstein's monstrous behaviour was exposed. Or to view as unrelated to the post-Weinstein world, female feticide in India; the hurling of sulphuric acid into the faces of women and girls in Asia – usually by men who've been spurned; or the fact that, in Kenya, female political candidates are known to have carried knives and wear several layers of clothing to deter attempted rape.\nA female circumcision ceremony in Uganda, a tradition in some parts of the continent. Photo: Getty Images\nBut this violence against women – in all its myriad forms – is the most persistent, widespread form of violence on the planet today, with the United Nations and the World Health Organisation estimating that one billion women have been raped or beaten. Australia is not exempt from this epic horror story. In 2001 the Australian Institute of Criminology reported that more than 1.2 million adult women had experienced an incident of sexual violence since the age of 15. Every week almost two Australian women will be killed by a current or former partner.\nTo pick just one of infinite examples, in 2012, Rachelle Yeo was stabbed to death in her home on Sydney's northern beaches by her former partner. Today, her father Roger Yeo is an ambassador for White Ribbon Australia, the organisation committed to engaging men in ending violence against women and girls.\n\"Kathy [Rachelle's mother] and I, and many others, have experienced the grief and impact of losing a daughter, a wife, a sister or niece to men's violence,\" he explained recently through the White Ribbon website. \"That impact reaches far beyond the direct impact on the victim and their immediate family. We understand now that for every tragedy affecting one victim, there are thousands of other lives affected.\"\nPerhaps, then, it takes a moment like this in history for men to truly wake up. Until now, I thought I was awake. For 23 years, I'd been married to a woman of strong feminist principles. I'd read the works of numerous feminist authors, and profiled women like Helen Garner, Germaine Greer, former New Zealand PM Helen Clark; the feminist warriors of Northern Ireland, the McCartney sisters, even Xena, the warrior princess (with whom I had a mock arm wrestle and … lost!) I'd worked for brilliant female editors and come to see how my own entrenched biases, assumptions and sense of entitlement had been shaped by the mere fact of being a privileged, straight, white male.\nIn 1987, early in my journalistic career, I'd reported on the Anita Cobby murder trial, where I heard evidence so shocking – about the rape, torture and slaying of that young Sydney nurse – that it would take me years to erase from my mind. Fifteen years later, I'd also sat in court and stared into the merciless, coal-black eyes of Bilal Skaf, the 21-year-old who had led the gang rapes of Sydney women and girls in the lead-up to the 2000 Olympics. As one of his young victims told me two years after the attack, the men had dragged her by her hair into Gosling Park in south-west Sydney's Greenacre where they'd repeatedly raped her, while pointing a gun at her head.\n\"I tried to kill myself [afterwards],\" she said. \"I kept cutting myself ... anything just to see blood. I would just get so worked up I would cut myself with a razor or a piece of glass. On one occasion I swallowed nearly a packet of Panadol. I just felt worthless. I felt dirty. I thought, 'Who is going to want me now?' I was in year 10 at the time and I was going extremely well, and then everything fell apart.\n\"You could never imagine that one event could change your life so dramatically. I used to just sit in my room and cry and cry and cry, and not come out.\"\nSo, yes, I thought I was awake to this rampaging male aggression, but the truth is I had absolutely no idea what women faced. No idea what it was like to feel afraid walking to my car, or jogging at night; to be pressed against on a crowded train; to be ignored or talked over repeatedly; to know that my value at work was often predicated on my sexual attractiveness to my boss. No idea what it was like to have someone indecently expose themselves to me; to have to devise strategies each day, often unconsciously, to just feel safe. No idea what it was like to be shamed, or reduced to the parts of me that could be breached.\nDuring the course of researching this article, I was horrified to hear that in the northern NSW town where my former wife and I raised our two daughters during the first decade of the noughties, the rape and abuse of teenage girls was purportedly not uncommon. Verbal and physical assault – young men urinating on girls, calling them \"whores\", \"fat cunts\", \"bitches\" and \"sluts\" – was also reputedly prevalent.\n\"I don't think what happens [there] is unique,\" says Ivy D'Orsogna, who grew up in the same town and is making a web series on the subject. \"There is definitely a feeling of xenophobia among a lot of the young guys – this is our town – and this sense of entitlement extends to the bodies of young women. There were prosecuted cases, but there were so many things that happened where boys were never charged or held accountable.\"\nNow Sydney-based, the 24-year-old daughter of award-winning screenwriter and producer Deb Cox ( SeaChange, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries and others) tells Good Weekend that in one incident, an underage girl was put \"on the spit\" by five teenage boys and penetrated with penises and other objects, while they filmed it on their iPhones.\n\"Many [teenage] girls I know who grew up there experienced sexual assault in one form or another,\" she says. \"For a while guys were also pissing on girls, or pissing into cups and throwing them on girls. They were just like dogs pissing on their territory. 'You're ours and we can do what we like with you.' \"\nThe #MeToo tidal wave that has crashed over the world has obviously empowered women to revisit their sexual histories, often in graphic detail. True, there has been a conflating of mild transgressions with the worst kinds of abuse; not to mention an abandonment of due process in some cases – a fact that should concern us all. But the common denominator here is a deeply embedded misogyny that expresses itself across the spectrum: stories of rape, abuse, harassment, belittlement, groping, stalking, accosting, grooming, intimidating, demeaning, pouncing, hurting, patronising (mansplaining), fat-shaming, objectifying. Stories of invitations where none existed. Stories of workplace gender pay gaps – which TV presenter Lisa Wilkinson had the courage and self-possession to expose last October at the Nine Network.\nStories of institutionalised enabling, where confidentiality clauses have been designed to shut victims up. (Did you note that, Channel Seven?) Stories of men refusing to take no for an answer; of women being pressured into having sex and/or being made to feel guilty if they didn't. Stories of horrifying emotional and psychological violence, where men use their children as weapons of punishment. Stories of shame and sadness and crippling loss of confidence; of the light inside a precious human heart being extinguished.\nAs Australian feminist writer Clementine Ford put it in her impassioned 2016 book Fight Like a Girl : \"A lot of the time, being a girl in this world hurts … to feel subjugated and alone, to know that the words you say, the ideas you have and the gifts you can contribute are all considered null and void, unless you offer them in a way that maintains the status quo.\"\nAnd so, the question we come to is: why? Why is it that men have killed, enslaved, scarred, diminished and silenced women of every age, race and class, on every continent, for so long? Yes, we know it's about the aphrodisiac of power and male privilege, and the way a woman's worth is so often seen as less consequential than a man's. But what lies at the rotting heart of all this?\nThe answer is an old one, and surely springs from patriarchy and its relentless war on the feminine. Since the beginning of recorded time, most cultures worshipped some version of the goddess. In ancient Mesopotamia, the vulva of Inanna, the Sumerian goddess, was a sacred site and Sumerians sang hymns to her \"lap of honey\". Agrarian societies honoured their female deities, as menstrual cycles were interconnected with the lunar-based agricultural cycles. The earth was Gaia, the ancestral Mother of life. She was inherent to all of Nature. She was nature, until the rise of patriarchal religions began declaring goddess worship and female sexuality the devil's work. Nature and woman needed to be tamed.\nAt the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, writer and director Jill Soloway ( Transparent) offered an intriguing insight into this when they (Soloway prefers \"they\" to the gender-specific he or she) said: \"Five thousand years ago cavemen saw women getting their periods and bleeding, and they bled in time with the moon, and they didn't die when they bled. And so prehistoric man thought that women were magic and they got scared. So they created language to just fuck with us.\"\nMan has been fucking with Woman for a long time … and not just through language. In ancient Greece the great lawmaker Solon decreed that a free woman could be sold into slavery for losing her virginity prior to marriage. The Hebrew Bible (Deuteronomy 22: 13-21) allowed for a father to stone his daughter to death if her wedding sheets were not bloodied. (Little wonder, then, that one of the morning Jewish prayers says: \"Blessed are you, Lord, our God, ruler of the universe who has not created me a woman.\")\nThe Church Fathers cast women as seductresses who lured men towards the abyss. Tertullian, the Latin Christian author, regarded as the founder of Western theology, described the vagina as a \"temple built over a sewer\", and \"the Devil's gateway\".\nWe had the chastity belts of the Middle Ages, where a husband could literally secure his wife's vagina with a series of iron metal body locks, before taking the keys as he travelled, or sallied forth to war. Across Europe, between the 14th and 17th centuries, tens of thousands of women – healers, priestesses, poetesses, midwives or, merely, women displaying signs of sexual independence – were tortured and murdered as \"witches\". As Naomi Wolf pointed out in her celebrated 2012 book, Vagina: A New Biography, one of the torture devices was known as \"the Pear of Anguish\" – a pear-shaped iron object that expanded inside the victim as the torturer turned the screws. Women's vaginas were often the target of searches for the \"witches\" or \"devil's\" mark.\n\"I cannot stress enough how many of our current anxieties about the vagina and about female sexual pleasure were introduced to society at this time and descend to us even now in forms recognisably dating to this period,\" she wrote.\nNaomi Wolf, author of Vagina: A New Biography. Photo: Sigrid Estrada\nThen it was the clitoris – the rapturous pleasure centre of a woman's birthright and freedom – that came to be seen as the cause of \"moral turpitude\"; a view that reached its apogee in Britain in the 1860s when Dr Isaac Baker Brown introduced clitorodectomies as a way of returning women to their required docility. (This practice is still widely employed across broad swathes of Africa and, to a lesser extent, the Middle East.)\nWho was it who decided a menstruating woman could not enter a \"House of God\", lest she defile it? Or that a woman's sexual agency and desire was such a heresy that it required her being put under control? The men who hungered for her, that's who.\nAnd now we see a rampaging male hunger, which has so ignited – as Australian writer Charlotte Wood put it recently – the global \"force of dark and furious energy inside women\".\nIt is no accident that it comes at a time when the most powerful man in the world stands accused of sexually assaulting or harassing at least 19 women, not to mention having been caught boasting on the infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape of moving on a woman \"like a bitch\"\n\"I'm automatically attracted to beautiful,\" Donald Trump said. \"I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it … Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.\"\nAccess Hollywood host Billy Bush, Donald Trump and actor Arianne Zucker in 2005, on the day of the infamous tape recording. Photo: Getty Images\nFor all Trump's grotesqueries, it's his contempt for women – and his at-the-ready unzipped fly – that has helped shine a light on the persistent brutality of the male libido. American Buddhist teacher John Bell put it eloquently in a lengthy online post for Yes magazine when he asked: \"What happened to boys that they grew up to feel they need sex so badly that this behaviour is so pervasive?\n\"What happened to men that they support a $US97 billion porn industry that produces 13,000 porn films a year (compared to Hollywood's 600 films), has 420 million porn web pages, and 68 million search engine requests for porn every day? No one is born a rapist, a sexual abuser or a porn addict; even the creepiest, sleaziest and most dangerous of these men began as sweet little boys. Something had to happen to make them into abusers.\"\nWhat happened, according to northern NSW-based Dr Arne Rubinstein, founding chief executive of The Making of Men (both an organisation and bestselling book), was that so many boys never actually grew up. Their bodies did, but their minds didn't.\n\"After puberty,\" Rubinstein says, \"they can become angry and lost because they're still operating from boy psychology. And to understand this boy psychology, you only need to picture the typical behaviour of a seven-yearold in the playground. He wants to be acknowledged all the time. He sees himself as the centre of the universe. He takes no responsibility for his actions. He finds it difficult to deal with his emotions. And he wants his mother.\n\"Whereas in the healthy man's psychology, a man sees himself as part of the universe, not the centre of it; he takes full responsibility for his actions, he deals with his emotions and he looks for a healthy relationship with the feminine. If you ask a lot of women if they know any men who are still doing the boy psychology stuff, the majority will actually say, 'Yeah, I married him.'\n\"The role modelling and mentoring for boys and teenagers is very poor, and the messaging is terrible. So that's what our organisation does – it gets men to help the next generation think about what it means to have a healthy relationship – with both the masculine and the feminine.\"\nWe've all grown up with the clichés that boys don't cry. They don't show fear. They keep a stiff upper lip. They suck it up, lest they be labelled a \"girl\" or a \"pussy\". All these stock phrases that shame the idea of being soft, compassionate or kind-hearted. And what replaces this, as John Bell observed, is \"a strutting of male power\" – perhaps the perfect image for the caricature of machismo currently on display in the White House. And yes, perhaps, the perfect image of what men do, not just to women, but to gays, queers, transgenders, bisexuals and, of course, other straight men – anyone considered different or a threat.\n\"For many men,\" Bell wrote, \"the huge, beaconing archway of healthy human need for closeness and love gradually gets bricked up, brick by hurtful brick, until the only available opening for all those real needs has been narrowed to a small keyhole called sex.\n\"Add extra testosterone, unrelenting sexual advertising and media images, and boyhood training to be aggressive to get what you want, and we can start to understand how sex for men has become so fraught, so distorted, so unhealthy, so compulsive, so desperate.\n\"Men are [taught] to be in charge, to hold all reins of power, to feel superior to women, to expect women to serve men in exchange for protection and security. The conditioning includes learning to not show feelings other than anger or toughness ... How many of us parents have watched our sweet toddler boys slowly lose their capacity to cry, or hide their tenderness to fit into the harsh teenage-boy culture? So as men, most of us grow up being cut off from our feelings, from our true loving nature, from our natural compassion, from easy relationships with most other men. We feel isolated, competitive, insecure, lonely and fake – though we can rarely admit it, and usually only in the safe embrace of a lover, if we're lucky. The reality is that men have a huge, lifelong reservoir of tears and fears to shed about all this trauma.\"\nI can hear voices being raised against these reflections: that they represent a derailment of the conversation we need to be having right now; that this moment calls for nothing less than listening to women, believing women, defending women, standing alongside women. In other words, this is not the time for men to play victim. This is the time to allow the flood of women's pain and profound outrage to wash over us.\nEve Ensler has every reason to fear and despise men, and to not want to hear what ails them. From a young age, she was beaten, bruised, choked, nearly murdered by her father, and yet her journey to the source of female suffering ultimately took her into the heart of male darkness. In her 2006 book, Insecure At Last, she described meeting a soldier in Kosovo in the late 1990s. His name was Agrim, and he seemed paralysed, both physically and mentally.\n\"For some reason,\" she wrote, \"he looked at me, threw his arms around my neck, and started weeping. No, it was more like wailing. I have never heard a sound like that. He would not let go. Then his weeping wailing began to build and release. It could not be controlled or stopped. It resounded through the neighbourhood. People from the village began to gather around.\n\"I held on to Agrim but, honestly, I wanted him to stop. All these years I had told myself I wanted men to be vulnerable, to have their feelings, to cry. All of a sudden it felt like a lie. I did not want this man to be so destroyed, so out of control. I wanted him to have answers and be tough and know the way and make everything work out.\n\"I understood how part of me was afraid of men being lost, how I needed them to be tough and sure. I understood how many years I had carried their invisible pain so I wouldn't have to see them weak or ashamed. This weeping liquid man in my arms was my undoing, pulling me out to sea in the wild waves of his crying.\n\"It was as if I were holding the secret story of men in my lap. Centuries of male sorrow and loss, centuries of unexpressed worry and doubt, centuries of pain. I suddenly understood violence and war. I understood retaliation and revenge. I understood how deep the agony is and how its suppression has made men into other things. I understood that these tears falling down Agrim's face would have become bullets in any other case, hardened drops of grief and rage directed toward a needed enemy. I saw how in fighting to live up to the tyranny of masculinity, men become driven to do anything to prove they are neither tender, nor weak, nor insecure. They are forced to cage and kill the feminine within their own beings and consequently the world.\"\nTalking to Good Weekend now, Ensler believes it is imperative that we work out how to overhaul patriarchal thinking once and for all. \"Are we going to fire every man?\" she asks. \"Are we going to put every man in prison? Are we going to punish every man? What is going to be the process by which we transform patriarchy?\n\"I've always said that men are … equally tyrannised by the patriarchy, sometimes more damaged by it, because at least women got to keep their hearts intact. Men have been removed from their tenderness, their tears; the centre of their own beings. So this is a really critical question for men. What are men going to do to help themselves break out of patriarchy and come into a new system where they get to be free to be tender, loving, caring, heart-opened, feeling beings?\"\nJeremy Meltzer, founder director of i=Change: 'I believe men's violence against women to be the most pressing human rights issue of our time.' Photo: Luis Enrique Ascui\nI know many men like this, as you no doubt do, too. Men who would never dream of making unwanted comments to a woman, touching her inappropriately, let alone trying to force her into non-consensual sex. I also know men who champion women's rights: like my friend, Melbourne-based social entrepreneur Jeremy Meltzer, who delivered a TEDx talk on this subject called Where is Men's Roar ?\n\"Can I ask you to raise your hands if you have a sister?\" he asked his live audience at the outset. \"Now leave your hand up and raise the other hand if you also have a daughter. Great, keep both of them up, and if you have a mum raise your knee.\" The audience was a sea of upstretched hands and knees. Meltzer then went on to cite UN statistics on the global pandemic of violence against women, calling it \"the most systematic and pervasive human rights abuse in the world\".\n\"What the hell is going on?\" he asked. \"Any one of these women could be our sister, mother or daughter. So where are the men? Where is men's roar? Not for the football, but for what really matters? [Because] this is the greatest moral challenge of our times.\"\nBorn and raised in Melbourne, Meltzer, 42, first witnessed violence against women in the late 1990s, while living in Latin America, Cuba, and Miami. \"I had a Cuban girlfriend at the time and met a lot of her community and heard so many stories of violence,\" he tells Good Weekend. \"At one point we almost became victims of her ex-boyfriend and had to leave town, and I became really angry at how normalised all this violence was.\"\nIn 2013 Meltzer established a social enterprise tech start-up called i=Change (The 'i' in i=Change denotes personal responsibility for change) whereby retailers commit a dollar of every online sale to causes such as helping non-government organisations end sex trafficking in Asia and pioneer new technologies in Uganda so that premature babies survive. While the customers choose where the dollar goes, the brands make the donation and, in the past five years, i=Change has raised $500,000 through partnerships with 40 retailers, both in Australia and internationally, that have directly impacted the lives of more than 115,000 women and girls.\n\"From what I've learnt and seen,\" says Meltzer, \"I believe men's violence against women to be the most pressing human rights issue of our time. Most ideologies, belief systems, institutions and religions that fundamentally minimise the feminine, control women and girls, ensure they don't realise their potential and, in many respects, denigrate them, hide them away from public life and ensure they're not educated, could only have been created by men, enforced by men, interpreted and implemented by men. To allow ourselves the illusion this is in any way preordained is beyond primitive, and a tragic outsourcing of responsibility.\"\nFor Meltzer, this is overwhelmingly a men's issue, for the simple reason that it is men who are wreaking the destruction. \"We pander to political correctness here because we don't call this what it is. We call it family violence, as if it's a toddler throwing a toy at his mum or a dog biting someone on the ankle.\n\"Family violence is mostly a man choosing to use violence against his partner. Violence is almost exclusively the domain of men. Who's doing the vast amount of killing? It's men. Who picks up the pieces, and fights to hold families together? It's women.\n\"Women build life, while we are adept at destroying it. Unless, as men, we begin to look at what it is in the male psyche, in the versions of masculinity we're born into and enforce upon each other, and begin actively engaging each other to become the solution to this issue, we'll be having the same conversation 500 years from now.\n\"We have to listen to women deeply – because too often we don't – but we have to cross the line to find the courage to confront and question what in the masculine psychology has normalised the profound desecration of the feminine? And we must create deep accountability, as men, for ourselves and with each other. What is it within our conditioning?\nWhat is it we have so deeply normalised that we are blind to? Nothing short of a revolution in the masculine is required, one which calls us to return to a healthy masculinity, that in our quietest moments, we are longing to inhabit.\n\"To achieve this is to aspire to an exquisite integrity, to a level of self-awareness where such violence – in our public or private lives – becomes impossible.\"\nEverything is now up for grabs, and the questions keep coming. How do we examine the mechanisms – and insistent call – of human desire, and the way this informs our behaviour? How does evolutionary psychology play into the differences between men and women, if at all? To what extent does the masculine libido, and its various pathologies, drive our culture, politics and economy?\nMost heterosexual men dream of the temptress, the endless wonder and diversity of the female form; after all, she's been inhabiting our imagination – our films, songs, literature and conversations – from the time our balls began heading south.\nWhen does a lumpen-footed move become a form of harassment? What does harassment actually mean? Is it a wolf whistle, a fondle, a lewd comment? What about a pass at a colleague after work – is that just poor training, or bad intentions? Or is this how couples so often come together, through some combination of risk-taking and bumbling awkwardness?\nAnd come to think of it, when the sun goes down, how do we corral our nocturnal sexual appetites, our private kinks and chinks? Do we follow Sweden's recent proposed changes to the law, so that victims only need to prove that an explicit consent was not granted in order to prosecute? What will happen to gender diversity in organisational culture if men run scared from working closely with women, especially if the allegations are at the more superficial end of the spectrum?\nDo we have, as Bret Stephens wondered aloud in The New York Times recently, \"the moral capacity to distinguish between aggressive sexual predation and run-of-the-mill romantic bungling – between a pattern of abusive behaviour and a good man's uncharacteristic bad moments?\"\nDoes it matter if the guiltless go down because, in any war, there's going to be blood? Emily Lindin, an occasional columnist for American Teen Vogue , thinks not. In a series of tweets late last year, Quote: : \"I'm actually not at all concerned about innocent men losing their jobs over false sexual assault/harassment allegations\" and \"If some innocent men's reputations have to take a hit in the process of undoing the patriarchy, that is a price I am absolutely willing to pay.\"\nAt least she was being honest, although the implications of this are truly alarming. What happens when a touch on the arm of a colleague at work, or a friendly \"x\" on the end of a text message, is misinterpreted for something more than it is? How do we steer a course through this war zone so that normal displays of affection aren't mistaken for something far more sinister? How do men find the courage to challenge other men – sometimes our close friends – when the conversations cross the line? Where exactly is that line, given that so often men's talk is shrouded in humour?\nWhat do we do now with some of our favourite creative works? If you're middle aged like me, do we reassess the pleasure we once derived from Woody Allen and Roman Polanski films because we know now all about their youthful obsessions or, as the case may be, their perversions? Do we return to those sex-soaked Philip Roth novels where there's a boundless phallus parading through nearly everyone of them?\nHow do we feel, for instance, about the late Helmut Newton's photography, and all the taboos he broke as the fashion world's most infamous provocateur: women wearing chains and dog collars, models in wheelchairs and neck braces, women with saddles on their backs, their buttocks up against washing machines, or the back seat of a car. (Newton actually carried a lot of the accessories in his own car: false nipples, handcuffs, whips, leg irons.)\nShould we now retrain our ears to old hits, such as Rod Stewart's Tonight's the Night , because we've re-listened to the lyrics and realise it could be about grooming an underage girl?\nDon't say a word my virgin child\nJust let your inhibitions run wild\nThe secret is about to unfold\nUpstairs before the night's too old\nThen there's pornography . How do we hold back the tide of teenage boys and their use of smartphones, with its unlimited access to the objectification of women? Do we get Google to examine its own gender biases because, when you look up a word like \"hysterical\", the first example of its usage is \"Janet became hysterical and began screaming\"?\nHow do we challenge teenage boys not to think of themselves as \"heroes\", \"legends\" and top dogs\" when they've had numerous sexual partners, while girls doing the same thing are called \"sluts\", \"hos\", \"whores\" and \"bitches\"?\nAnd here's another thorny one. How do we stop mothers from internalising – and thereby perpetuating – the patriarchy by the way they raise, and talk to, their sons and daughters? Or the way they bury themselves in work, just as absentee fathers have done for so long? Or, far more subtly, the way they often protect the core fragility of a man's ego, because they know only too well what could happen if he collapses into shame. He could hurt himself, or someone else.\n\"As men are falling, women are rising,\" wrote Maureen Dowd in The New York Times recently, and that is both a terrifying and electrifying thing to witness. Terrifying because there is nothing good about a broken man – not for himself, his children, his partner, his friends or his community.\nTerrifying also, because – as we have seen with Brexit and the election of Donald Trump – millions of working-class men (and women, too) will blow up a system when they feel disempowered by forces beyond their control. Brokenness begets brokenness.\nBut it is also beyond thrilling to imagine a world where the potential of female power, passion and ingenuity might be unleashed, as it has been to varying degrees in China, Rwanda, Botswana and Morocco over recent times. In 1994, Rwanda lost nearly one million people during the genocide, yet, a decade later, was one of the fastest growing economies in the world – thanks in large part to female participation in the workforce and gender equality in political life. (Women today hold 61 per cent of seats in the lower house of Rwanda's national legislature, compared to 29 per cent in Australia.)\nMuhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi Nobel Peace prize-winner, and father of microcredit, lends almost solely to impoverished women in the developing world, because he knows their families and communities will benefit more than if he extends loans to men.\nMillions took to the streets in women's marches across the US in January this year, showing the anger and energy unleashed by Donald Trump and the #MeToo campaign. Photo: Getty Images\nAcross the globe, the mighty force of female power is asserting itself; at the same time as women are continuing to be abused, commodified and dehumanised. The very week that Trump was heard bragging on the Access Hollywood tapes about grabbing \"pussy\", a new book called Pussy: A Reclamation , by Regina Thomashauer, was hitting The New York Times bestseller list with its exhortation to the reclaiming of true feminine power.\n\"Most women in the world are operating from a huge amount of scarcity and ignorance in our sensual lives – and our lives overall,\" Thomashauer wrote. \"Women have been ignored for centuries. We were never the priority. Our hunger was never met.\"\nThe #MeToo campaign is a symptom of this furious hunger, both ancient and contemporary. Ever since the second wave of feminism in the 1960s, women have been sharing their stories, setting up hotlines, helping each other, writing books, songs, plays, films; marching, agitating, dancing for their right not to be abused or silenced.\nNow, it's different. Now, we're all joined to the information superhighway, and the exemplar of patriarchal aggression and arrogance sits in the White House, bestriding the world. Something extraordinary has been triggered within the collective psyche and we're only beginning to sense what's still to come.",

        "text": "New Delhi [India], Feb 9 (ANI): Many cancer treatments affect the ability to become pregnant, temporarily or permanently.\nFertility preservation (FP) is an effort to retain the fertility of cancer patients, thereby improving their quality of life.\n\"Due to the tremendous rise in risk of cancer , it becomes essential to opt for preserving fertility. After the cancer treatment, a woman's body might recover naturally and produce mature eggs that can be fertilized. However, the medical team may recommend waiting for six months to two years before trying to get pregnant. The length of time depends on the type of cancer and the treatment used,\" said Dr. Priti Gupta Fertility & IVF Expert, First Step IVF Clinic, New Delhi.\nFertility Preservation Options:\n- Egg freezing\nEgg freezing is a well known method of preserving fertility in women. It might be a good choice for women who do not have a partner. For egg freezing, mature eggs are removed and frozen. Once the woman is ready to become pregnant, the eggs can be thawed, fertilized, and implanted in her uterus.\nA new method of freezing called vitrification has made egg freezing more efficient and successful. Another alternative could be to freeze half the eggs and fertilize the rest with sperm from a donor and then freeze embryos.\n-Embryo freezing\nThis is the most established and successful method of preserving a woman's fertility. Mature eggs are removed from a woman's ovaries and fertilized in the lab. This is called in-vitro fertilization (IVF).\nThousands of sperm are put in a sterile dish with each egg. Sometimes one sperm is injected into each egg .The embryos are then frozen to be used after cancer treatment. A woman will have a better chance of a successful pregnancy if several embryos are stored.\n\"For women who are less than 35, a single embryo transfer is the safest way of using IVF to get pregnant so as to avoid multiple pregnancies,\" said Gupta.\n- Ovarian tissue freezing\nThis process involves removal of all or part of one ovary by laparoscopy. The ovarian tissue is usually cut into small strips, frozen, and stored. Ovarian tissue freezing lets women freeze a vastly larger number of immature eggs for future use. When frozen ovarian tissue is re-implanted into the body and regains its functions, immature frozen eggs within the tissue start developing normally.\nPost cancer treatment, the ovarian tissue is placed in the pelvis. Once the transplanted tissue starts to function again, the eggs can be collected and fertilized. The ovarian tissue does take blood supply and she is to produce hormones after its transplanted.\n-For women who are not fertile after cancer treatment\nDonor egg is an option for women who have a healthy uterus but do not have any eggs. Egg donation is often a successful treatment for women who can no longer produce healthy eggs.\nAlso, any woman who has a healthy uterus can maintain a pregnancy by the utilizing the donor embryos.

        "text": "Barb Marinello has worked in the East Leyden cafeteria for the last decade, serving food to students and teachers each school day with a friendly disposition.\nMarinello hasn't been at work since before the holidays, though, after she was diagnosed over winter break with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that develops in plasma cells, which are mainly found in bone marrow.\nIn response, Leyden boys basketball coach Bill Heisler and his squad selected Marinello, a 1975 East Leyden graduate, as the recipient for the team's annual Coaches vs. Cancer fundraiser.\nThe #Ballin4Barb event was held Friday in conjunction with Leyden's West Suburban Gold home game versus Proviso East, which the Eagles lost 74-47 in Franklin Park. The fundraiser not only netted $9,250 for Marinello to use toward her medical expenses, according to Heisler, it also showed the collective strength that a school community can exhibit.\n\"I can't put into words what this means to me, to have so many people go to these lengths to help me,\" said Marinello, who attended the game. \"I'm used to taking care of other people, so it's been a little hard to accept. But wonderful.\"\nThere were several layers of fundraising employed the week of the event, the most visible being the white \"Crush Cancer\" T-shirts that dotted the boisterous crowd.\nFor $10, people got the T-shirt and admission to the game, where $1 donation cards were also available. The T-shirts and cards raised $2,250, according to Heisler, and the food services staff raised $4,000 by selling raffle tickets during lunch periods and at the game for 64 donated gift baskets.\nEric P. Davis / Pioneer Press Leyden boys basketball coach Bill Heisler wears a “Crush Cancer” T-shirt during the Feb. 2, 2018 game against Proviso East in Franklin Park.\nLeyden boys basketball coach Bill Heisler wears a “Crush Cancer” T-shirt during the Feb. 2, 2018 game against Proviso East in Franklin Park.\n(Eric P. Davis / Pioneer Press) In addition, the local Unity in Community Foundation pledged to match up to $1,000 in funds raised.\n\"Barb is such a sweet, upbeat lady and the love that she gives every day is the biggest reason so many people have gotten behind this cause,\" said Heisler, now in his 11th year as Leyden's head coach. \"Everyone has really embraced this.\"\nSoon after her diagnosis, Marinello began treatment, which includes radiation therapy and twice-weekly chemotherapy sessions at Alexian Brothers Medical Center in Elk Grove Village. She also takes medication daily. Her first treatment cycle is slated to end Thursday, at which time Marinello will take a week off before launching into another 28-day round.\n\"The radiation was absolutely terrible, and I've had to incorporate some different things lifestyle-wise, like changing my eating habits,\" Marinello said. \"But I've felt such an outpouring of love. The people here are like a second family.\"\nPart of that family includes Leyden's players.\nJunior point guard Kyler Britten didn't need any prodding to be all-in on #Ballin4Barb.\nIt wasn't long after he arrived on campus as a freshman that he came to expect Marinello's upbeat demeanor during what can sometimes be long, stressful school days.\n\"If she sees a kid not smiling, she'll crack a joke to make them feel welcome and happy,\" said Britten, a Franklin Park resident who scored 12 points in the loss. \"You don't really see a lot of people like her nowadays. She's a friend that you want to have in your life because she always makes you feel better.\"\nOn Friday night the Leyden community attempted to return the favor.\nSteve Reaven is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.\nTwitter @Pioneer_Press\nWhat is your first, worst, thirst car?

        "text": "Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN) On the house that Farris Barakat built, the words of Martin Luther King Jr. wrap around the porch overhang, as though they were protection from the outside world: \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\"\nIt took his brother's death for Farris to fully embrace those words. In February 2015, Deah Barakat was gunned down along with his wife of six weeks, Yusor Abu-Salha, and her sister Razan. News of the triple slaying at a Chapel Hill apartment complex reverberated here and around the world as another instance of hatred toward Muslims. A neighbor was charged with three counts of murder but not a hate crime -- sparking further outrage. The deaths yanked Farris from his life's trajectory and set him on one he had not anticipated. Read More At 24, he abandoned his courier business and everything else to speak out against hate. He devoted much of his time to renovating a 105-year-old rental house his brother had owned in a rundown neighborhood east of downtown Raleigh. Farris named it for his brother. Deah means \"light\" in Arabic, and The Light House now serves as a center for youth, a gathering place Farris hopes will further Deah's dreams for a more tolerant America. Here, at this house, Farris hopes to find the light that was so cruelly snuffed out. Farris named The Light House for his brother and inscribed the words of Martin Luther King Jr. to serve as hope for a more tolerant America. Farris and Deah, sons of Syrian immigrants, were only 18 months apart in age, a grade apart in school and an inch apart in height. Farris feels his brother's presence most strongly in The Light House -- not through things Deah left behind or memories they shared, but through the ideals espoused here. Farris was certain Deah would be alive today had it not been for his faith, and he felt a religious duty to parlay his brother's story into easing the nation's fears. Strangers probably would never sit and listen to Farris talk about Islam, but they were willing to pay attention in the context of tragedy. Farris focused on turning his grief and anger into something positive. He needed to see a sapling sprout from fire-scorched earth. He allowed The Light House to consume him. Three years passed in this way. All around him, Farris saw his community shattered by the tragedy. He saw the consequences of hatred haunt his Muslim neighbors. But he also saw hope in a city that was proud of its diversity and in people struggling to heal. He found new friends along the way. One, in particular, was most unexpected. Our Three Winners One spring afternoon, when it is neither hot nor cold, neither dark nor light, Farris and his mother, Layla, climb into his minivan to make the drive westward to Chapel Hill. It's graduation weekend, and the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry is holding its commencement ceremonies this evening. Deah would have been marching today with the Class of 2017. Farris and Layla agonized over whether to attend. Farris worried their presence would cast a pall on the joy of others; Layla feared it would be too much to bear. In the end, Layla decided she had to go. For Deah. In the afternoon, as she does every Friday, she'd driven to a mosque in Deah's old Honda Accord, his black-and-white checkered keffiyeh still draped over the driver's seat. Then, as she does every Friday, she visited Deah's grave, No. 429, at the Muslim Cemetery in nearby Wendell, and sat, deep in prayer, with her youngest child. \"Someone was there to visit him today. There were fresh flowers there,\" she tells Farris as he merges onto Interstate 40. Farris felt compelled to talk peace and faith to drown out the loud chorus against Islam. It's after 5 p.m. and Farris concentrates on driving amid a sea of red taillights. Layla stares at the raindrops on the windshield, rivers shrieking across glass. God's tears. In the morning, she had taken Farris to a Men's Warehouse to shop for suits. He had gained weight in the aftermath of Deah's death and needed a size 46. He had aged on the inside and out. \"Did you wear a tie?\" Layla asks. She had asked him to wear school colors. That's what Deah would have done. Farris whips out a dotted tie he's wearing with a crisp blue shirt. Some might call it United Nations blue. But around these parts, there's only one descriptor: Carolina blue. Layla nods in approval. They drive past the road they'd turned onto so many times to visit Deah. Layla's husband, Namee, had bought 272 Summerwalk Circle, a ground-level, two-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium in the Finley Forest complex, for his son to live in while he attended dental school. Layla studied architectural engineering as a young woman in Aleppo and had taken great pride in designing her home. After Deah married Yusor, she helped them set up theirs. Just a week before they died, they'd installed a sparkling new stainless-steel sink in their black granite countertop. They beamed with pride like parents with their firstborn. Deah and Yusor's families had worked hard to make it in America. Deah's father, Namee, owns real estate and several small businesses including a convenience store. Layla raised their three children and went back to school at North Carolina State University to earn a master's degree in computer science. Yusor and Razan's parents, Mohammad and Amira Abu-Salha, were Palestinians who lived in Jordan and Kuwait before coming to America. He was a psychiatrist and she, a pharmacist by training, helped him run his practice. Farris, Deah and their older sister Suzanne had attended Al-Iman, the Islamic grade school at their mosque. So did the Abu-Salha children. Deah and Yusor met as kids and became a couple when they were at North Carolina State. Everyone was delighted when they got engaged. In February 2015, Deah was 23 and a second-year star student at the UNC dental school. He dazzled people with his charm. He loved basketball, watched \"SportsCenter\" and was such a huge fan of Steph Curry that following Deah's death, the Golden State star wore a special pair of sneakers honoring him at the NBA All-Star Game. Yusor, fine-boned with curly hair and big hazel eyes, shared her husband's love of basketball, hung out with her girlfriends and obsessed over playing the video game \"Call of Duty.\" At 21, she was preparing to follow in her husband's footsteps at the dental school and had just received her letter of admission. Razan, 19, was a runner and the creative one, an aspiring student of design and architecture. Her Twitter profile said, \"I like buildings and other stuff,\" and her posts were typical of a bleary-eyed college student downing venti coffees to study. All three were popular and high achievers, known in the Raleigh area for their charitable work with the poor and homeless. Deah traveled to Jordan to provide dental services for Syrian refugees and was raising money for future clinics. Yusor, too, had flown to Turkey on a volunteer mission to help Syrians and was planning to join her husband on a future trip. They were all-American kids who were keenly aware of their Muslim identities. They lived their lives in accordance with Islam. They avoided alcohol and, when they came of age, the women chose to cover their heads. Before they were married, Yusor often visited Deah at his condo. Razan was always with her sister as a chaperone -- it was not deemed proper for Yusor and Deah to be alone together. Yusor looked like a fairy-tale princess in her beaded white gown at her December wedding to Deah. They flew to Mexico for a honeymoon and after they returned home as a married couple, they often invited friends and family over. Just days before they died, Yusor's parents had come over to watch the movie \"Selma.\" This photo of the Barakat family, taken before Deah's wedding, sits in Layla's living room. The 1980s condo complex was filled with graduate students and young professionals and for the most part, life was quiet in the shade of tall Carolina trees. But Deah and Yusor quickly became aware of the man living above them in No. 270. Craig Hicks was a burly 46-year-old white man who was studying to become a paralegal at Durham Technical Community College. His Facebook page revealed a man out of the ordinary. He did not specifically bash Muslims but held organized religion in contempt. A Quote: he posted said, \"People say nothing can solve the Middle East problem. Not mediation, not arms, not financial aid. I say there is something. Atheism.\" Hicks harbored a deep love for guns, and neighbors said he showed \"equal opportunity anger.\" He frequently complained to Deah that visitors to the complex had usurped parking spaces reserved for him and his wife. Deah checked with the management to make sure he was not violating the rules and even sketched out the parking lot for his friends to make sure they never parked in reserved spaces. On occasion, Hicks revealed a gun in his holster. Yusor grew scared. She texted Deah about her fears: Our neighbor is always walking around us with a gun. He's always looking at me. Would he be doing this if we were white? I feel unsafe. They discussed whether they should tell the police about Hicks. But they didn't want to provoke him in any way. Deah assured his wife that their disgruntled neighbor was smart enough not to use his gun. He was wrong. On February 10, a little after 5 p.m., Hicks allegedly found a car belonging to one of the victims in what he claimed was his parking space and went into a blind rage. According to the prosecutor's account, Hicks armed himself with a .357-caliber handgun and walked to Deah and Yusor's condo. When Deah opened the door, Hicks pulled out the gun and shot him multiple times. Farris, left, and Deah were 18 months apart in age, a grade apart in school and an inch apart in height. Yusor and Razan began screaming for their lives. Both were shot in the head, according to the state medical examiner's autopsies. On his way out, Hicks pointed his gun at Deah again and shot him a final time in the mouth. The man who was studying to become a dentist died with his teeth missing and his mouth disfigured. Before the sun had set that Tuesday evening, Deah, Yusor and Razan lay cold in pools of blood. They had been killed execution style. A little while later, Hicks turned himself into law enforcement and was subsequently charged with three counts of first-degree murder. His trial is expected this year, and if convicted, he faces the death penalty. The events of that night burn brightly in Farris' and Layla's minds. They remember receiving texts about a shooting at UNC. Layla called Yusor's father, Mohammad. She was frantic. She'd heard three people had died and that Deah might have been involved. They dialed their children's cell phones. No one answered. They got in their cars and raced to the Finley Forest complex. Mohammad remembers almost crashing his car on the way. By the time they got there, the police were everywhere. They were told by police to wait in the community center. Five and a half hours later, they knew their gravest fears were true. \"Deah took the bus home from UNC at 4:50,\" Layla recalls. \"He and a friend took a photo on the bus. At 5:08, it was done.\" These are the kinds of details Layla can never forget. JUST WATCHED Sister of slain Muslim student: We are in shock, denial Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nSister of slain Muslim student: We are in shock, denial 03:18 In a news conference, police said the three students had been shot because of a parking space dispute, a claim that incensed the families. They felt it trivialized the true nature of what they saw as a heinous act against Muslims: a hate crime. They could not accept that their loved ones, who had been previously taunted by Hicks, were gunned down over a small piece of asphalt. The FBI and Department of Justice launched investigations into whether this was indeed a hate crime, though no determination has yet been made. But for the families and the greater Muslim community here in America and abroad, the official classification didn't matter. They saw the killings as manifestation of a disturbing and rising trend: Islamophobia. People listen during a vigil at UNC Chapel Hill in February 2015. Farris had spent nearly half his childhood in a post-9/11 world and had grown accustomed to phobias, as much as anyone can ever get used to them. He was no longer surprised by the vitriol hurled at Muslims, especially in the aftermath of terrorist attacks perpetrated in the name of Islam. Or by the mosque vandalisms, or by the polls that showed nearly 40% of Americans held an unfavorable view of the religion. But nothing could cushion the shock of his brother's slaying. He returned home that awful night and, still in a state of utter devastation, launched a Facebook page. He offered friends and strangers alike an outlet, a place where they could feel connected to the families. He wanted a space where he could try to control the spread of what he saw as rumors and misinformation. Most of all, he felt compelled to talk peace and faith to drown out the loud, offensive chorus against Islam. He called the page Our Three Winners. A trying day Farris and Layla approach the Carolina campus for what should have been a celebration. Deah had wanted to be adentist for so long. Today would have been the fruition of his wishes. Instead, Farris and Layla walk into a crowd of people who struggle to find the right words. Some of the students have adorned their tassels with charms bearing the logo of the Three Winners, a silhouetted illustration of Deah, Yusor and Razan. After he buried his brother before a crowd of more than 5,000 people, Farris launched headlong into establishing the Our Three Winners Foundation , which funds humanitarian missions that reflect the ideals of the fallen three. Farris dedicated himself to honoring their legacy by improving relations between Muslims and the community at large. The Class of 2017 at the University of North Carolina dentistry school honored Deah at its commencement ceremony. He began speaking publicly and returned to the house that Deah owned in east Raleigh. He put up new drywall, installed modern kitchen appliances and outfitted the bathrooms with bidets. He purchased a Sonos system so that the sounds from an upstairs prayer room could be heard throughout. There's even a 3-D printer in the office. He hoped people would see The Light House as an example of how to respond to hate; he even dared to hope it would become a symbol for all of America in dealing with the fear and bloodshed that consumed the nation after 9/11. The Our Three Winners Foundation joined a project started by activist and CNN commentator Van Jones to launch a #LoveThyNeighbor campaign. Deah, Yusor and Razan had all attended North Carolina State, and their alma mater set up scholarships in their names. It also sponsored a Run for Razan to raise money and inspire young people. Razan was training for the Raleigh Rock 'N' Roll half-marathon when she was killed. At UNC, Deah's dental classmates set up DEAH DAY, short for Directing Efforts And Honoring Deah And Yusor. Once a year, the school canceled classes for a day of dental and nondental charitable work. At the commencement ceremony, Deah's classmate Kaushal Gandhi, one of the founders of DEAH DAY, shows Layla and Farris her tassel charm. On the stage is a framed portrait of Deah and a mortarboard and sash. Layla stares at them from her seat up in the stands of Carmichael Arena. Pride and grief begin to churn as one. She fiddles with her phone when the emotions become overwhelming. Sometimes, she feels she has nothing left in this life anymore. She dreams of being reunited with all her children again and counts the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years. Time feels like a treadmill to nowhere. She watched from afar as her beloved Syria descended into intractable civil war that ripped apart family back home and razed the places she held dear. Then she lost Deah. And in the months that followed, she felt strain in her marriage -- it's not uncommon for relationships to suffer in the aftermath of trauma. Layla lost the one thing human beings need to feel grounded. She lost her sense of belonging. She tries to find inner peace by surrendering to God. But in moments like this, the rawness takes over. Layla watched as her beloved Syria descended into bloodshed and war. Then her son was killed. She finds solace in her faith. In the middle of the commencement ceremony, Brian Swift, president of the Class of 2017, says a few words about his fallen classmate. \"Our class is forever bonded by the tragic and untimely death of Deah,\" Swift begins. \"He led by example and he led by heart. We miss him every day. He is a part of the fabric of our lives.\" Swift notes the presence of Deah's family and asks Layla to identify herself. Everyone stands as they applaud her. Layla does not know where to look or how to act in that moment. Or how to hold herself together. When the processional ends, she makes a frantic dash for the stage to collect Deah's mortarboard and sash. She accepts a bouquet of roses from the university and clutches her son's photograph. She can no longer keep up the charade or keep her eyes dry. Farris hugs his mother. He had decided long ago that his happiness meant not letting himself feel vulnerable. After Deah died, Farris quit playing basketball for a while because he found it was too easy to explode in a competitive situation. He kept his anger and public grief in check by living the words of Martin Luther King Jr., by doing right by his brother. Tomorrow would test him again. Deah and Yusor had married six short weeks before they were killed, and their wedding would always be indelibly etched in Farris' and Layla's memories. The next evening, Farris and Layla were planning to attend the wedding of Yusor and Razan's brother, Yousef. No matter how hard Farris tried, he knew that sometimes, nothing, not even his honorable actions, and maybe not even his faith, could protect him from grief. The UNC graduation ceremony was one of those moments. Amid the laughter and joy resounding in the convocation hall, mother and son find solace in one another. Together, they let torrents of tears flow. Anxiety In another part of Raleigh, Hanadi Asad pulls back her long dark hair and dons an apron advertising Cajun Joe's, the chicken franchise her father once owned. She is decorating macaroons and boxing up baklava and other butter and honey-soaked Mediterranean deserts for the weekend farmer's markets. She's also baking a four-tier wedding cake and manages the tasks at hand like a master juggler. Yousef Abu-Salha is getting married, and Hanadi knows the cake, the flowers, the ambience -- everything -- has to be perfect. The Muslim community in the Raleigh area is fairly close-knit, and Hanadi knows both families of the shooting victims. \"It's a big deal because it's the Abu-Salha family,\" she says. \"You see the happiness and you see broken hearts in their eyes. I wanted to take away some of their stress and let them enjoy their son's wedding.\" Deah had tapped Hanadi to do the décor for his wedding, and in her smartphone, Hanadi still keeps the last texts she exchanged with him. She told him her daughter Julann had asked for blankets to donate to Syrian refugees in lieu of presents for her sixth birthday. Hanadi Asad, here with her husband, Jamaal, and their five children, is trying to grow her dessert and event business at a time that feels uncertain. \"That's beautiful,\" Deah texted Hanadi. Hours later, he was dead. On this Saturday morning, the texts are from Yousef. He wants to make sure the cream-cheese icing is just right. At first, the Abu-Salha family was not sure whether a celebration would be appropriate so soon after their daughters' deaths. Would people think they were crazy to wear fine attire, eat scrumptious food and dance the night away? But Hanadi understood. How could they allow tragedy to stop their lives? How could they deny their son his moment of joy? Like the Abu-Salhas, Hanadi's family is Palestinian. She was born in Kuwait and was 8 when she arrived in America in 1985 with her parents and siblings. Raleigh was a small Southern city then, still healing from the scars of segregation. There wasn't even a mosque nearby; Muslim families congregated in private homes to pray. But as Hanadi grew, so did the city around her. Immigration soared in the 1990s -- fueled in part by agriculture, universities and the tech companies of the Research Triangle -- and people from all parts of the planet were lured to the greater Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area. For decades, Muslim immigrant families settled here largely without incident. Although they only form about 1% of the 2 million-plus population here, as their numbers grew, they established mosques and schools and became a part of the social fabric. Residents took pride in the area's growing diversity and boasted about its inclusivity. These days, signs that say, \"Welcome to Raleigh, y'all\" in 17 languages plaster walls, bulletin boards and store windows. The campaign was launched by a nonprofit organization called Come Out and Show Them, which previously advocated on behalf of LGBTQ rights after a controversial \"bathroom bill\" required people to use public restrooms matching the gender on their birth certificates. Come Out and Show Them chose to focus on immigration after it became such a hot-button issue in the 2016 presidential campaign. With their families by their side, Deah married Yusor on December 27, 2014. Six weeks later, they were dead. By then, after Deah, Yusor and Razan were killed, Muslims here were already feeling the same anxiety that threatened to overtake their lives after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. That anxiety heightened with the election of Donald Trump, a president they viewed as being anti-Muslim. One of the most visible signs of discomfort: Some women began uncovering their heads. But others refused to surrender their faith. Shortly before she was married, Yusor had tweeted: \"Hijab is my constant reminder that we aren't living for this world...#Perseverance\" Those became words to live by for Muslim women like Hanadi. They drew strength, too, from the Our Three Winners logo that sported the hijabs of Yusor and Razan. It's wrong to uncover in public once a woman has committed herself to doing so, Hanadi believed. If Hanadi did not wear the hijab, she might \"pass\" for white with her fair skin and freckles. She knows she has an easy way out, but she remains resolute. \"Am I going to fear people or fear God?\" she asked herself. Her eldest daughter, Raiyan, is 15 and must decide soon whether to cover. Some of her friends already have. But Raiyan likes to leave her long, thick curls on full display. She fights with her father about clothes -- a pair of leggings had too much see-through mesh on the thighs. JUST WATCHED Sister of UNC victim: Shooter terrorized our family Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nSister of UNC victim: Shooter terrorized our family 07:16 Hanadi feels sure her daughter will make the right decisions when she is ready. Without the hijab, Hanadi would be any other 40-year-old wife and mom of five kids. She enjoys chicken salads at Panera, gets pedicures on the weekends and enjoys shopping with her girlfriends. Her big splurge this year was a Louis Vuitton bag. Hanadi studied biochemistry at North Carolina State and for years worked in the pharmaceutical industry. But a few months after the killings, she quit her job and decided to get entrepreneurial with her true passions: baking and design. She named her business Asali, a combination of her and her husband's last names and, appropriately, an Arabic word for honey. Hanadi put herself on hire to bake desserts and plan events. She runs her business from a three-story house in the bedroom community of Apex, just west of Raleigh. It's in chaos with giggling high school girls, cartoons on television and craft projects strewn about the dining table. The pantry and garage are bursting with things for baking and event-planning: cake pans, cardboard gift boxes, powdered sugar, vases, flower cutters, ribbons, table runners, candle holders. She's been hunting for a retail space, one with a commercial kitchen and enough room to host parties. She began growing Asali at a time that felt uncertain. The news of the UNC killings reverberated throughout the Muslim world. Here, women attend a rally in Amman, Jordan. In Hanadi's childhood, people stared at women in hijabs out of curiosity. Now, people stared at her in a way that made her feel unsafe. She wondered how small-town folks who frequented the farmer's markets would react to a Muslim woman. Sometimes, she assumed the worst. One time, a man she described as being \"very country\" was watching her at the Apex Farmers Market. He listened intently to her conversation with a customer. When she was finished, she asked him: \"Do you have any questions?\" What she really wanted to ask was: \"Are you here to kill me?\" That's how it is these days for Muslims in America, she says. But the man was polite. He even gave her $20 for a box of desserts. \"It's only $10,\" Hanadi told him. He told her to keep the change. She sighed with relief. Sometimes, she notices Facebook friends ranting against Muslims. It offends her, but she never unfriends them. She feels it's important to know what they are saying. That included posts by her neighbors expressing their support for Trump after he called for the travel ban on Muslims entering the United States. That made Hanadi think twice about living in Apex, but where else could she go? As a Palestinian, she has no homeland. Besides, she is American. North Carolina is home. When Muslims all over America were recoiling, Hanadi refused. She forged forward with Churchillian resolve, determined to prove that Muslims worked hard and wanted the same successes in life as everyone else. She listened to podcasts by entrepreneurs such as Jerry Murrell, the founder of the hugely successful Five Guys burger chain. One day, Asali, too, would be a household name. She knew that she had to step outside the Arab community to be successful. It was one thing to sell baklava on Western Boulevard, where shops named after Mecca and Medina sell halal meat and restaurants brim with falafel and shawarma. It was another thing to have shoppers at upscale North Hills clamoring for more. Giving in to her fears, she felt, meant a victory for the man who killed Deah, Yusor and Razan and for everyone else caught up in what she feels has been a tidal wave of Islamophobia. \"My mother always says, 'What if Trump bans hijab? What if things get worse for us?' \" Hanadi says. \"Is taking off my hijab really going to change anything?\" she asks. \"They will still hear my name. So where do we stop?\" A group of students plan a book exchange at The Light House. Farris wanted the house to be a gathering place for young Muslims. It was important for Hanadi, after she began working from home, that she continue to interact with people outside her community. It was key, she believed, to wiping out ignorance, key for her children's sake. She hears questions that serve as proof of how much work is left to be done. Are you a Pakistianian? Why does Islam force women to cover their heads? Do you have to marry your husband's brother if your husband dies? Hanadi has heard these all her life. Sometimes, people are surprised when she first speaks to them. \"Oh, your English is so good,\" they say. Why wouldn't it be? Hanadi thinks. I grew up here. Still, she operates with a dark cloud lingering overhead, suspicious of the world around her. On her desk, she keeps a Mother's Day card her son Idrees made at school: \"Even though I annoy you and you annoy me. I still love you.\" Hanadi is raising five children, and she knows it could be her own family who one day faces a gunman's ire, like Deah, Yusor and Razan did. She tells her own children to emulate the Three Winners in a way that when they die, no one will have anything negative to say. The white dude On Fridays at the Islamic Association of Raleigh, one man stands out in the sea of worshippers mainly of Middle Eastern and South Asian heritage. He's tall at 6 feet 4, and he's dressed impeccably in khaki trousers, a freshly pressed shirt and bright yellow tie. He's also the only white guy here. The first time Wilson Fowler walked into a mosque, everyone turned and stared. They thought he might be a crazy dude who was going to whip out a gun at any moment. Wilson understands. He would be suspicious of himself, too. Of the world's 1.8 billion Muslims, not too many look like him. Wilson Fowler converted to Islam amid anti-Muslim sentiment in America. He and Farris quickly became close friends. Wilson met Farris through youth groups after he had been introduced to Islam. Wilson is only a year younger than Farris, and the two quickly grew to be the best of friends. Now when he reflects on his past, Wilson laughs, though strangers might not even be apt to believe his story. Until recently, Wilson had led life according to the script handed to him as a boy. He grew up in Indiana and Texas, the son of a music teacher and a pharmacist. He went to church every Sunday and attended every youth camp. His parents split when he was in the fourth grade, and Wilson divided his time between the two before enrolling at Appalachian State University. He joined Lambda Chi Alpha and lived up to every stereotype of frat boy life. He guzzled beer, dated a lot of girls, dabbled in drugs. He skipped classes his first semester, and only after he was placed on academic probation did he start to straighten up. He graduated with a degree in finance and economics and landed a job at a Raleigh bank. Wilson's world had been all white, conservative and Christian. He had never interacted with a black person until his mother moved from Indiana to Fayetteville, North Carolina. He'd never seen Muslims until he saw them on television after 9/11. He got nervous every time he saw someone with a long beard or turban board his flight. Then one day, a friend introduced him to one of her Muslim acquaintances, Sapphira. She in turn asked Wilson to accompany her to a volleyball match. \"I was the only white guy there,\" he recalls. \"I didn't know what to say, how to act. I was nervous I would offend someone.\" Spphira texted him verses from the Quran and soon presented Wilson with his own copy of Islam's holy book. Wilson was intrigued. He liked the morality presented in the Quran. He signed up for a 101 class at the Islamic Association of Raleigh. He began voraciously reading the Quran every night before turning the lights out, just like he had read verses from the Bible as a boy. And he began questioning his entire belief system: If Jesus preached the message of one true God, then why can't there simply be one God and no trinity, no partners associated with God? He felt the power of Islam, he says. He felt it calling. In September 2016, at the height of the presidential campaign when Trump was talking about bans on Muslims, Wilson converted to Islam. He adopted a conservative Muslim lifestyle. He stopped drinking and dating women. He struggled with his job as a banker -- money has no intrinsic value in Islamic finance, and earning interest off loans is prohibited. He doesn't miss alcohol, but it has been hard for Wilson to reconcile his faith with his job. He's still thinking on that one. His conversion affected his politics as well. By the time November rolled around, Wilson could no longer bring himself to cast a vote for the candidate he supported. Though he agreed with Trump's fiscal and social conservatism, he could not ignore Trump's call for a travel ban on Muslims or other comments the candidate made that Farris and other Muslim friends found inflammatory. Wilson's loved ones were crushed by the changes in him. Don't be a terrorist, his father told him, only half joking. On a bulletin board at The Light House are sticky notes posted by visitors. They are meant to be messages of hope and inspiration. His friends and family tried to convince him to come back to their world. But Wilson was sure he had done the right thing. A few weeks before the UNC graduation, Wilson joined Farris at a youth camp Farris organized at Falls Lake state park. It was Deah's dream to support youth and their projects, and Farris believes strongly in giving them a community. Young Muslims gathered for a weekend of fellowship and frivolity. There, they didn't have anything to fear. They didn't have to run from their identity. They grilled chicken, roasted marshmallows and took group pictures of themselves among tall pines with a camera-equipped drone buzzing high above the lake. Wilson was in awe of Farris' dedication to others. He'd met a lot of Muslims who had much to teach him about Islam, but Farris lived it every day. The Prophet Mohammed struggled his whole life, but his followers constantly looked up to him for answers. Farris, Wilson thought, tried hard to emulate the prophet's actions. Wilson saw Farris surrounded by people almost every waking hour. He saw Farris never take a day off, whether for The Light House or the Our Three Winners Foundation or simply to help someone in need. On bad days, when Wilson felt down or upset, he thought of Farris and his altruism after the loss his family suffered. It couldn't be easy, Wilson imagined, to extend a hand to strangers outside his own circles when an outsider had killed his brother. Farris became Wilson's inspiration as a Muslim man, a Muslim American. In turn, Farris recognized the power of Wilson's journey. At the youth camp, Farris asked Wilson to address the crowd. He thought it would be good for the teenagers to hear from someone who had not been afraid to risk all and embrace Islam. In a way, the white dude was the best role model of all. They laughed when Wilson told them how people at the mosque thought he was going to kill them the first time he walked in. They listened intently as Wilson laid out why he chose Islam. And they smiled when they heard him say this: \"It's the best thing that has ever happened to me.\" Though he is open about his faith, Wilson knows he still has to tiptoe his way through life sometimes. He's still the privileged white man on the outside, but on the inside he's become a part of a minority much reviled by many in his circles. At work, he closes the blinds to his office to pray. He's wary of people seeing him lie prostrate or raise his hands and say, \"Allahu Akbar.\" But on Fridays, it's different. He stands among rows and rows of men at the mosque, facing east toward Mecca, bowing together and falling to their knees before Allah. This is the mosque where Farris and Deah and the Abu-Salha women had prayed all their lives. The white American newcomer feels very much at home here. Not just a Muslim but an American On a November evening, hundreds of people from Raleigh's Muslim community have turned out at the Green Road Community Center to raise money for a new mosque. It will be named The Winners, in honor of Deah, Yusor and Razan. Farris and Layla take their seats at the table nearest the stage, next to Wilson and Yusor and Razan's parents, Mohammad and Amira. In front of them is a model of The Winners complex: 7 acres of land off US 401 that will contain a mosque, community center, soccer field, gymnasium, private houses, commercial centers and streets named after the three slain students. It's a community project not related to Farr Mohammad has been asked to say a few words before the fundraising begins. \"For us as families, life is difficult,\" he tells the crowd. \"It's post-traumatic stress disorder. It's pain every day. It's flashbacks. It's details that you all do not know. It's nightmares. It's insomnia. It's exhaustion. And then all your relationships change. All your perceptions of the world change. And going to work every day is an act of God's will.\" Zainab Baloch ran for the Raleigh City Council and headquartered her campaign at The Light House. One of her political signs was defaced with a Nazi symbol, the word \"Trump\" and a derogatory term for Middle Easterners. Farris thought of his own work as God's will. He was determined to create a more tolerant world so no one would have to feel the sting of hate like he did. Over the last few months, he'd been reminded of the importance of the mission he's undertaken. In September, he and Wilson flew to Jordan to deliver supplies to a Syrian refugee camp. From there, they journeyed by road to Jerusalem to pray at al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, and see the Dome of the Rock, where Muslims believe the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven. \"In the footsteps of prophets and in the footsteps of Deah,\" Farris wrote on Facebook. Farris found it amusing that he and a Jordanian friend had the most trouble getting through security points and their white friend, who had never stepped foot on Middle Eastern soil, sailed through. But it wasn't really funny. It summed up everything he felt as an Arab Muslim. He saw ugliness toward Muslims in America, even in his hometown. Each time, he took action. When immigration authorities arrested and threatened to deport Mosa Hamadeesa, a Palestinian in Apex whose daughter has a rare medical condition, Farris wrote a letter of support calling Mosa a genuinely honest man. When 17-year-old Nabra Hassanen was brutally slain in what police called a \"road-rage incident,\" Farris drove up to Fairfax County, Virginia, to show his support to the Muslim community there. Just like Farris is convinced Deah, Yusor and Razan were targeted for being Muslim, Nabra's family, too, feared her death was a hate crime. Farris took a photo of police tape at the crime scene, a rainbow spanning the sky above. He believed violent crimes against Muslims were taking place more frequently because they were blamed for societal grievances and being turned into the \"other.\" \"Whether it's a mind that is taught to hate specifically Muslims or not, the problem is that it's a mind that is primed with the propensity to hate at all,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"Every murder is hateful.\" And when Zainab Baloch, the 26-year-old daughter of Pakistani immigrants, announced her candidacy for an at-large seat on the Raleigh City Council, she headquartered her campaign at The Light House. Zainab went to middle school with Yusor and Razan and, like Deah, was president of the Muslim Student Association at North Carolina State. She ran as a millennial, a woman of color and a sweet-tea-loving Southerner. She had a gazillion ideas about affordable housing and making the city more livable. But a few weeks into her campaign, one of her small billboards was spray-painted with a swastika and the words \"Trump\" and \"sand nigger.\" Farris was hardly surprised, though it brought more disappointment. And yet another reminder that he had to keep going. Zainab did not win, but one of her signs still hangs at The Light House: \"The world we live in is a house of fire and the people we love are burning.\" At the mosque fundraiser, Mohammad ends his speech with words that resonate with Farris. \"It's not just a building,\" Mohammad says of the new complex. \"We can build hearts and souls and minds and generations that will tell everybody in America that we are all Americans and we are here to stay, that we belong to this land.\" Farris had never intended to become an activist, but after Deah's death, he devoted himself to creating an awareness of Islam that might help prevent future acts of hate. Of late, he'd given a lot of thought about expanding his efforts, of what it meant to be an American. At Ramadan last summer, he was frustrated that the imams offered prayers for Afghanistan, Iraq, Burma and Syria. But what about prayers for America? What about climate change? Wealth disparity? Health care? Racism? \"I get this feeling that now that we are in this privileged country, we are in a position to have to take on the causes of those countries less fortunate than us,\" Farris wrote on Facebook. \"Which is true; but we also aren't all that great nor will we continue to be unless we invest and pray for our own communities.\" After Deah was killed, a darkness descended on Farris and Layla. Their dog AJ makes them smile. By night's end at the mosque fundraiser, $350,000 in donations pour in and the crowd turns its attention to guest speaker Omar Suleiman , a charismatic young imam from Dallas who's gained fame with his sermons of inclusivity. Suleiman is a big fan of Muhammad Ali and reminds the crowd that Ali was much more than a star boxer, that Ali's moral strength was borne from his adherence to Islam. \"You need to serve the people around you,\" Suleiman says. \"People will remember how you make them feel.\" That was Ali's legacy. It is Deah's legacy, too, Farris believes. And now it could be his own. Farris takes Suleiman to The Light House. He wants the young imam to see the culmination of three years of work. Deah, Yusor and Razan are gone from this world but not forgotten, Suleiman says, and The Light House is an example of how Our Three Winners are still winning. Just two nights ago, a small crowd of mostly women had gathered at The Light House to watch \"Equal Means Equal,\" a documentary on gender inequality. They wore skinny jeans, matte lipstick and hijabs of all cloths and colors. Wool, silk, cotton, polyester. Black, blue, taupe. They sprawled themselves on the carpeted floor of the prayer room and passed around a family-size tub of buttered popcorn. Most of the women were affiliated with a nonprofit The Light House supports: Muslim Women For. A table brimming with feminist literature also included hygiene products that made Farris blush. The organization was one of several The Light House project now supports. Another program is called Notable Pursuits, which showcases the lives of young Muslims -- not because they were attacked and made the news, but because of the remarkable work they are doing every day. These days, Farris spends long hours here, in the house he built. It is where he feels safe, where he can be himself. He can cry here. He can run upstairs to pray and submit himself to God. He drives home, to the house in which he grew up with Deah, to rest his head for the night. But The Light House is where feels at his best, his white labradoodle, AJ, by his side. Farris rescued AJ from an owner who no longer wanted him. At first, Layla was aghast; she hails from a culture that does not always tolerate dogs inside the home. But AJ came from heaven. He makes Layla smile when there isn't much to smile about anymore. On this clear and cold night, Farris gazes upward to the heavens, taking stock of his journey. King's illuminated quotation on The Light House shines like a beacon of hope summoning all to enter. More and more, Farris feels compelled to stretch his reach, to be not just an advocate for the few but to address the concerns of the many. In looking ahead, he wrestles with matters that relate to his identity not just as a Muslim, but as an American. That, he feels, is the patriotic thing to do.",

        "text": "print \nBy John Shiffman and Reade Levinson \nPORTLAND, Oregon (Reuters) - On July 20, a Hong Kong-flagged cargo ship departed Charleston, South Carolina carrying thousands of containers. One of them held a lucrative commodity: body parts from dozens of dead Americans. \nAccording to the manifest, the shipment bound for Europe included about 6,000 pounds of human remains valued at $67,204. To keep the merchandise from spoiling, the container’s temperature was set to 5 degrees Fahrenheit. \nThe body parts came from a Portland business called MedCure Inc. A so-called body broker, MedCure profits by dissecting the bodies of altruistic donors and sending the parts to medical training and research companies. \nMedCure sells or leases about 10,000 body parts from U.S. donors annually, shipping about 20 percent of them overseas, internal corporate and manifest records show. In addition to bulk cargo shipments to the Netherlands, where MedCure operates a distribution hub, the Oregon company has exported body parts to at least 22 other countries by plane or truck, the records show. \nAmong the parts: a pelvis and legs to a university in Malaysia; feet to medical device companies in Brazil and Turkey; and heads to hospitals in Slovenia and the United Arab Emirates. \nDemand for body parts from America — torsos, knees and heads — is high in countries where religious traditions or laws prohibit the dissection of the dead. Unlike many developed nations, the United States largely does not regulate the sale of donated body parts, allowing entrepreneurs such as MedCure to expand exports rapidly during the last decade. \nNo other nation has an industry that can provide as convenient and reliable a supply of body parts. \nSince 2008, Reuters found, U.S. body brokers have exported parts to at least 45 countries, including Italy, Israel, Mexico, China, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. Whole bodies are studied at Caribbean-based medical schools. Plastic surgeons in Germany use heads from dead Americans to practice new techniques. Thousands of parts are shipped overseas annually; a precise number cannot be calculated because no agency tracks industry exports. \nMost donor consent forms, including those from MedCure, authorize brokers to dissect bodies and ship parts internationally. Even so, some relatives of the dead said they did not realize that the remains of a loved one might be dismembered and sent to the far reaches of the globe. \n“There are people who wouldn’t necessarily mind where the specimens were sent if they were fully informed,” said Brandi Schmitt, who directs the University of California system’s anatomical donation program. “But clearly there are plenty of donors that do mind and that don’t feel like they’re getting enough information.” \nMedCure shipments are now the subject of a federal investigation. In November, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the company’s Portland headquarters. Though the search warrant remains sealed, people familiar with the matter say it relates in part to overseas shipping. \nMedCure is cooperating with the investigation, said its lawyer, Jeffrey Edelson. He declined to comment on the FBI raid, but said: “MedCure is committed to meeting and exceeding the highest standards in the industry. It takes very seriously its obligation to not only deliver safe specimens securely, but to do it in a way that respects the donors.” \nEdelson also said MedCure “partners with government and industry agencies to follow and exceed requirements for shipping human tissue,” and that “shipping handlers, drivers and carriers are specially trained for the safe handling and transportation of human specimens.” \nINFECTED PARTS AT THE BORDER \nAs a Reuters series last year revealed, the body donation industry is so lightly regulated in the United States that almost anyone can legally buy, sell or lease body parts. \nAlthough no federal law expressly regulates the body trade, there is one situation in which the U.S. government does exercise oversight: when body parts leave or enter the country. Border agents have the authority to ensure that the parts are not infected with contagious diseases and are properly shipped. \nThis authority played a leading role in the government securing a conviction last month of Detroit broker Arthur Rathburn, who stored body parts in grisly, unsanitary conditions, according to trial testimony. The FBI began to focus intently on Rathburn’s business, International Biological Inc, after repeated border stops in which he was found ferrying human heads, court records show. \nThe jury found that Rathburn defrauded customers by supplying body parts infected with HIV and hepatitis. \n“The fraud scheme orchestrated by IBI shocked even the most experienced of our investigative team,” said FBI special-agent-in-charge David Gelios. Even in death, Gelios said in a statement after the verdict, donors were “victimized as IBI intentionally and recklessly marketed and transported contaminated human remains… Personal greed overcame decency.” \nRathburn was also convicted of transporting hazardous materials — the head of someone who had died of bacterial sepsis and aspiration pneumonia. The transportation conviction underscored the U.S. government’s growing concern about shipments of body parts that might endanger public health, officials said. \nMartin Cetron, director of Global Migration and Quarantine for the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, said that when brokers dissect a body that is infected, there is added risk of transferring that disease to anyone who handles the parts. \n“In the case of saws (used) to cut bones or limbs, there may be additional procedures that could potentially turn a fluid into an aerosol that could be inhaled and be communicable,” Cetron said. \nA Reuters review of government records shows that border agents intercepted body parts suspected to be infected at least 75 times between 2008 and 2017. Border agents pay more attention to goods entering the country than those departing, and virtually all of the intercepted shipments were remains of American donors whose body parts were being returned to United States. Typically, body parts are returned to America for three reasons: to comply with foreign laws on final disposition; when cremation is not available in the foreign country; or when a U.S. broker intends to reuse the parts. \nIn 2016 and 2017, for example, federal agents stopped shipments being returned to MedCure at the border, law enforcement records show. The body parts they stopped included torsos carrying infectious biological agents that cause sepsis, a body’s extreme response to infection. At least one carried the life-threatening MRSA bacteria, the records show. \nFor more than a year, records show, U.S. officials and some body brokers have disagreed over whether the presence of sepsis in a corpse — without further information about a person’s cause of death —poses enough of a risk to warrant special packaging and warning labels. \n“Sepsis itself is not a disease diagnosis but it raises a red flag,” said Cetron, the CDC official. The pathogen that caused sepsis, he said, “could be a bacteria, could be Ebola, could be salmonella, could be E. coli.” That’s why further documentation, including a death certificate, must accompany any body part imported into the United States, he said. \nThe CDC has an exemption intended to allow for shipping blood and other lab testing samples. Reuters found dozens of examples of brokers labeling customs manifests and packages with a version of the term “exempt human specimen” to ship body parts. \n“I think that’s a deceptive practice,” Cetron said. “If they are human remains, part or in whole — heads, arms, limbs, etc. — they are not exempted.” \nSeveral brokers said the government should clarify the rules — whether the CDC’s or those of other regulatory entities. They cited, for example, a U.S. Department of Transportation regulation that, they believe, exempts body parts. Transportation officials declined to comment on their regulations. \nAlyssa Harrison, executive director of Oklahoma-based broker United Tissue Network, said most in her industry want to follow the law. But, she added, “there are many guidelines that are unclear and or contradictory to other department’s regulations.” \nThe disconnect between what the industry and government believe is dangerous, and what precautions are required by law, should be resolved, said Matthew Zahn, chairman of the public health committee for the Infectious Diseases Society of America, a group that represents doctors, researchers and other health professionals. \n“It’s a situation where we don’t have a huge amount of regulation or clarity as to what the risks are,” Zahn said. “It feels like one of those cracks in the system where a practice has developed and the risk factors and oversight have not fully matured.” \nEXPORTING AMERICANS \nMedCure, founded in 2005, describes itself, as do most body brokers, as a non-transplant tissue bank. It has distribution hubs and surgical training centers near Portland, Oregon; Las Vegas; and Providence, Rhode Island. The company also has distribution hubs near Orlando and St Louis. \nWhen MedCure donors die, the cadavers are transported to one of these five U.S. hubs. According to former employees, MedCure deploys a temperature-controlled truck to carry body parts between the five facilities. \nMedCure began shipping cadavers and body parts overseas as individual orders, one by one, and largely by airplane. The former employees said the company later calculated that it could increase profits by shipping bulk quantities of body parts to Europe, and distributing them from there. \nIn 2012, MedCure opened its European hub in Amsterdam. Since then, MedCure has sent to the Netherlands at least six refrigerated cargo containers filled with frozen human remains, manifest records show. The first container — 40 feet long, 8 feet wide, 9.5 feet tall — departed the Port of Tacoma in Washington state in July 2012. The body parts weighed about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg) and were valued at $259,210. \nMedCure continued to export via truck and plane as well — for example, shoulders to a hospital in Mexico, knees to a surgical training center in Taiwan and a head to a university in Chile. \nThe shipments are detailed in internal MedCure documents and in data from two companies that collect trade manifests: Descartes Datamyne of Ontario, Canada, and PIERS, a unit of IHS Markit Maritime & Trade, based in London. \nOne reason foreign doctors and researchers rely on U.S. companies for body parts: Their nations restrict the dissection, sale and distribution of donated cadavers. \nIn many nations, certain sects of religions – from Judaism to Islam to Taoism — frown upon separating the bodies of the dead into parts. Huang Yi-Ling, who worked in Singapore for a medical device manufacturer, said that importing body parts from the United States avoids “conflict with donor intent” in regard to religion. \n“MedCure makes donor tissue available for researchers and teaching facilities even in places where religious and cultural norms discourage body donation,” said Edelson, the MedCure lawyer. \nHolger Gassner, director of the Finesse Center for Facial Plastic Surgery in Regensburg, Germany, said he began importing body parts from the United States in 2009 because he couldn’t obtain the volume of heads he needed locally for medical conferences. He also said most German anatomy departments use formalin to preserve bodies; MedCure supplies fresh body parts, which are more useful for teaching. \n“You have to practice on human tissue in order to become a good or better surgeon,” Gassner said. “There’s no alternative.” \nGassner described MedCure as “very reputable” and noted that it sent an inspector to Germany to approve his facilities. “At the end of the day,” he said, “this has been a very positive thing for us and for the university.” \n“SERIOUS WORRY” \nThe FBI search of MedCure in November is part of a national investigation by the bureau of body brokers, many of whom did business with each other. \nMedCure, for example, was among the brokers who supplied Rathburn, the Detroit businessman convicted last month. MedCure was not accused of supplying any body parts at issue in the Rathburn trial. \nA different Rathburn supplier, Steve Gore of Phoenix, pleaded guilty to providing customers with infected body parts. A Reuters report in December described how Gore’s business used construction saws to dismember donated bodies and employed an untrained intern to rip out cadavers’ fingernails with pliers. \nIn early 2016, authorities stopped nine torsos that were being returned from Vancouver, Canada, to MedCure in the United States. According to U.S. government records reviewed by Reuters, some torsos were infected with sepsis. At least one had MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. \nBorder officials in both countries struggled to verify the identities of the torsos and how they were used. The records show that officials determined that a Vancouver-area bioskills seminar to which the torsos were purportedly sent did not exist. \nCanadian and U.S. officials said they do not comment on specific cases. Edelson, the MedCure lawyer, said the government's account is inaccurate and “the training course was a legitimate medical program.” He said the company does not sell or rent out human remains infected with HIV or hepatitis, and that body parts with other “non-contagious conditions are shipped overseas only with the permission of the CDC, including CDC permit, proper labeling and packaging and full disclosure” to its foreign clients. \nIn January 2017, another shipment being returned to MedCure from Hong Kong was stopped at the U.S. border. This one contained six torsos with legs. MedCure had sent the body parts to the Orthopaedic Learning Centre at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which trains surgeons. \nThe specimens were used to test the biomechanics of a knee implant procedure, including the impact of the technique on muscles connecting to the pelvis and femur, said the center’s director, Jack Chun Yiu Cheng. The doctor would not disclose which company or individual had organized the workshop. \nReuters reviewed a copy of the MedCure medical summary accompanying the specimens noting that two of them carried sepsis, including one from a donor who died in part from “septic shock.” When asked about the summaries, Cheng said there was not enough information provided to determine what caused the septic shock, but he said that he would not have used the body parts himself. \n“I would have serious worry,” Cheng said. \nAny training workshop carries risk, he said. But going forward, the doctor said, the training center will probably reject torsos with sepsis, “or at least discuss it directly with the workshop leader, not just send them the forms.” \nEdelson, the MedCure lawyer, said the company discloses appropriate medical information. He added, “Recipients are medical professionals who are expected to use basic safety precautions when handling any human tissue, including wearing gloves, masks and scrub suits.” \nREADING THE FINE PRINT \nSome donor relatives said they were disappointed to learn their loved one’s parts were sent overseas. \n“I should have read the fine print,” said Marie Gallegos, whose husband’s head was shipped to a dental school in Israel months after he died of a heart attack in May 2017. \nSix hours after he died, she said, an employee from Donate Network of Arizona called to discuss body donation. The employee promised the body would advance medical research and be treated with dignity, Gallegos said. \nShe recalled signing two consent forms, one for Donate Network and one for the company she was told would handle the cremation, United Tissue Network. The UTN form authorized use of her husband’s body parts “both domestically and internationally.” \nLater that summer, UTN delivered her husband’s ashes, which she buried at a veterans’ gravesite. She said she did not realize the ashes represented only a portion of her husband’s remains. UTN still had his head and in the fall shipped it to the Tel Aviv dental school. \n“Had I known that my husband’s head was over there, I would have waited to have the ceremony,” she said. “If they really wanted my husband’s body for these purposes, they should have told me upfront and verbally.” \nDonor Network declined to comment about this case. UTN executive director Alyssa Harrison said, “We make it very clear for families to understand our whole process before deciding to donate.” \nHEADS IN LIMBO \nIf not for the keen eye of a Phoenix airport worker, Marie Gallegos might not have learned what became of her husband’s remains. \nOn November 1, as Daniel Gallegos’ head and the heads of six other donors were returning from Israel to UTN in Arizona for cremation, someone noticed a discrepancy on the shipping documents. According to records reviewed by Reuters, the shipping manifest described the contents as “electronics” valued at $10 each. A label on the coffin-sized package described the contents as human remains. \nGovernment records show that border officials were troubled that the package appeared punctured and a strong smell was wafting from the box. They also demanded death certificates to ensure that the specimens were disease-free, records show. One of the donors, records show, carried staphylococcus aureus, an infection the CDC website says poses a potentially serious risk to healthcare workers. \nAfter officials stopped the package in Arizona, documents reviewed by Reuters show, UTN employees disagreed with border authorities about whether the package was damaged or death certificates were required. It took three weeks to resolve the dispute, according to the documents. The government then released the heads and they were cremated. \nUTN’s Harrison told Reuters the electronics designation was “human error” and the package was sent in a leak-proof container. She disputed the government’s contention that further documentation should have accompanied the shipment, arguing that “a diagnosis of sepsis in the clinical setting does not confer any specific risk.” \nHarrison said UTN and the freight company followed all laws and regulations covering the export and import of human medical specimens. \n“The CDC should not have gotten involved,” she said. \nMilli Raviv, whose Tel Aviv-based International Dental Studies center leased the heads from UTN, said her school maintains “high standards” to protect students. \nOn shipping documents, Raviv was listed as the contact person in Israel for shipping the heads back to UTN’s Phoenix office. Even so, the dentist professed ignorance about why the package was mislabeled. \n“No idea about shipping,” she said. \n(Reporting By John Shiffman and Reade Levinson.

        "text": "  Blood bank / Blood bank stores 16,000 units, sufficient for Tet Blood bank stores 16,000 units, sufficient for Tet   \nYouths donating blood (Photo: qdnd.vn) The total blood volume is sufficient to meet medical treatment needs in Hanoi and northern localities from now to at least three weeks after Tet (Vietnam’s traditional New Year) holiday, he said. The Tet holiday lasts from February 14 to 20. The NIHBT needs a minimum of 1,500 units of blood daily to provide for emergencies and medical treatment at 180 hospitals in Hanoi and northern provinces. Of the amount, 45 percent need to be Type O, equivalent to about 700 units. On January 5, the institute reported to have only some 6,000 units of blood available, raising concern over a severe blood shortage during Tet. Blood type AB accounted for the smallest proportion of 5.8 percent, of 352 units, followed by type O which made up 16.8 percent. Meanwhile, there were over 3,370 units of blood type B, representing 56 percent. It has called on agencies, organizations and particularly those with blood Type O to take part in blood donation campaigns. The appeal has met with warm response from the public. Following Tet, the annual Red Spring Festival will be held in a week, starting from March 10, Khanh noted. The blood bank expects to collect 1,000 – 2,000 units of blood each day of the festival.

        "text": "Urgent call for blood donations by American Red Cross   6: 14 PM The call went out in late January. Severe winter weather was causing canceled blood drives, resulting in a blood and platelet shortfall. The American Red Cross called the situation critical and issued an urgent call for donors. Scott C. Smith scsmith@wickedlocal.com @scsmithreporter \nThe call went out in late January. Severe winter weather was causing canceled blood drives, resulting in a blood and platelet shortfall. The American Red Cross called the situation critical and issued an urgent call for donors. \nThe American Red Cross saw more than 550 blood drives canceled through the third week of January due to the weather. That caused more than 16,500 blood and platelet donations to go uncollected during that time. In Massachusetts 28 drives were canceled, causing 750 donations to go uncollected. On top of that, the Red Cross says, the bitter cold and widespread flu contributed to low turnout at many blood drives held. \n“Blood and platelet donations are currently being distributed to hospitals faster than they are coming in,” said Kelly Isenor, external communications manager of the Massachusetts Red Cross Blood Services Region, at the time. “Donors are critically needed to restock the shelves for patients in their community as well as other areas where donors are unable to give due to inclement weather.” \nIsenor broke down some numbers for the paper. \n“In Massachusetts, the Red Cross must collect 135,946 donations each year to meet the needs of hospital patients,” she said. “That averages out to about 372 units every day. If you’re donating whole blood (the most common) one donor gives one unit, but there are some exceptions – like what we call Power Reds, where one donor gives two units of red blood cells but the platelets and plasma are returned to the body.” \nA donor can give whole blood every 56 days, platelets every seven days up to 24 times a year, Isenor said. If you’ve given whole blood, you can still give platelets after seven days. Power Red donors can give every 112 days. \nThere are many uses for donated blood products. \n“Red blood cells are used for surgery, trauma, blood loss, internal bleeding and for the treatment of blood disorders like anemia or sickle cell disease,” Isenor said. “More than 50 percent of the platelets we collect are used in cancer treatments, but they can also be used for organ transplant patients and for surgical recovery. Plasma is used for burn victims and to treat shock, as well as certain bleeding conditions and autoimmune disorders (if you’ve ever heard of IVIG treatment – it’s made from plasma).” \nSee additional information below. \nThe Red Cross does rely on volunteers to assist in the many blood drives. But blood donations are only done by trained, paid, phlebotomists, Isenor said. \n“Ideally, a donor is with the same phlebotomist throughout the process,” she said. “In other words, the phlebotomist who takes your health history in private does the ‘stick’ and is the same person to walk you over to the canteen area for recovery after the donation itself is finished. We do use volunteers at most blood drives, but not to collect blood. Volunteers are usually the ones greeting donors at the registration table or manning the canteen area. They may also help staff with signage before and after a drive, and certain volunteers may train to become transport drivers. Staffing levels vary depending on the size of a drive and the number of appointments – in addition to the phlebotomists, there is always a team supervisor in charge and usually a contact from the host site to assist with logistics.” \nAs to the blood taken during a donation, here’s how it breaks down. \n“Whole blood is divided into three components with different uses and shelf lives when it gets back to our lab,” Isenor said. “Red blood cells may be refrigerated for up to 42 days. Platelets must be stored at room temperature, on special moving shelves called agitators to prevent clumping (we joke that they’re the newborn babies – extremely fragile, and must be rocked at all times). Plasma can be frozen up to a year.” \nSee additional information below. \nWhen supplies run low, blood supply becomes a balancing act. \n“We work with our hospital partners on a daily basis to prioritize the need and make sure the right products are getting where they are needed most,” Isenor said. “In a worst-case scenario, a doctor may decide to postpone an elective surgery if the appropriate blood products are not available – but again, that is a worst case scenario. If it looks like the supply is headed towards a concerning level, we up our messaging to donors and the public to encourage more donations.” \nIf you wish to help during this blood donation shortage, you can make an appointment to give blood or platelets by downloading the free Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting redcrossblood.org or calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). \n“All blood types are needed to ensure a reliable supply for patients,” Isenor said. \n\nDonating blood – here’s what happens \nStep 1, the donation \nHealth history and mini physical are completed. \nAbout 1 pint of blood and several small test tubes are collected from each donor. \nThe bag, test tubes and the donor record are labeled with an identical bar code label to keep track of the donation. \nThe donation is stored in iced coolers until it is transported to a Red Cross center. \n\nStep 2, processing \nDonated blood is scanned into a computer database. \nMost blood is spun in centrifuges to separate the transfusable components – red cells, platelets, and plasma. \nThe primary components like plasma can be further manufactured into components such as cryoprecipitate. \nRed cells are then leuko-reduced. \nSingle donor platelets are leukoreduced and bacterially tested. \nTest tubes are sent for testing. \n\nSteps 2 and 3 take place in parallel. \nThe test tubes are sent to a blood testing laboratory. \nA dozen tests are performed on each unit of donated blood – to establish the blood type and test for infectious diseases. \nTest results are transferred electronically to the manufacturing facility within 24 hours. \nIf a test result is positive, the unit is discarded and the donor is notified. Test results are confidential and are only shared with the donor, except as may be required by law. \n\nWhen test results are received, units suitable for transfusion are labeled and stored. \nRed Cells are stored in refrigerators at 6ºC for up to 42 days. \nPlatelets are stored at room temperature in agitators for up to five days. \nPlasma and cryo are frozen and stored in freezers for up to one year. \n\nStep 5, distribution \nBlood is available to be shipped to hospitals 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \nAll information courtesy of   \n\nBlood components \nIn modern medical treatments, patients may receive a pint of whole blood or just specific components of the blood needed to treat their particular condition. Up to four components can be derived from donated blood. This approach to treatment, referred to as blood component therapy, allows several patients to benefit from one pint of donated whole blood. The main transfusable blood components include: \n\nWhole blood contains red cells, white cells, and platelets (about 45% of volume; white cells and platelets are less than 1%) suspended in plasma (about 55% of volume). Most of the donated blood collected by   is used for direct blood transfusions. Common types of blood transfusions including platelet, plasma and red blood cell transfusions. \n\nRed cells, or erythrocytes, carry oxygen from the lungs to your body’s tissue and take carbon dioxide back to your lungs to be exhaled. A patient suffering from an iron deficiency or anemia, a condition where the body does not have enough red blood cells, may receive a Red Blood Cell Transfusion. This type of transfusion increases a patient’s hemoglobin and iron levels, while improving the amount of oxygen in the body. \n\nPlatelets, or thrombocytes, are small, colorless cell fragments in the blood whose main function is to interact with clotting proteins to stop or prevent bleeding. Platelets are a component of blood that stops the body from bleeding. Often patients suffering from leukemia, or other types of cancer, have lower platelet counts as a side effect of their chemotherapy treatments. Patients who have illnesses that prevent the body from making enough platelets have to get regular transfusions to stay healthy. \n\nPlasma is a fluid, composed of about 92% water, 7% vital proteins such as albumin, gamma globulin, anti- hemophilic factor, and other clotting factors, and 1% mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones and vitamins. Plasma is the liquid part of the body’s blood. It contains important proteins and other substances crucial to one’s overall health. Plasma transfusions are used for patients with liver failure, severe infections, and serious burns. Cryoprecipitated Antihemophilic Factor (Cryo) is a portion of plasma rich in clotting factors, including Factor VIII and fibrinogen. It is prepared by freezing and then slowly thawing the frozen plasma. \n\nMore... \nRed Blood Cells (RBCs) are perhaps the most recognizable component of whole blood. RBCs contain hemoglobin, a complex protein containing iron that carries oxygen through the body. The percentage of blood volume composed of red blood cells is called the “hematocrit.” There are about one billion red blood cells in two to three drops of blood, and for every 600 red blood cells, there are about 40 platelets and one white cell. \nManufactured in the bone marrow, RBCs are continuously produced and broken down. They live for about 120 days in the circulatory Red Blood Cells (RBCs) system. Red blood cells are prepared from whole blood by removing plasma, or the liquid portion of the blood, and they are used to treat anemia while minimizing an increase in blood volume. Improvements in cell preservation solutions over decades have increased the shelf-life of red blood cells from 21 to 42 days. \nRBCs may be treated and frozen for an extended storage, of 10 years or more. Patients who benefit most from transfusion of red blood cells include those with chronic anemia resulting from kidney failure or gastrointestinal bleeding, and those with acute blood loss resulting from trauma. \n\nPlatelets are small blood components that help the clotting process by sticking to the lining of blood vessels. Platelets are made in the bone marrow and survive in the circulatory system. Platelets help with clotting. \nPlatelets are prepared by using a centrifuge to separate the platelet-rich plasma from the donated unit of whole blood. Platelets may also be obtained from a donor by a process known as apheresis, or plateletpheresis. In this process, blood is drawn from the donor into an apheresis instrument which separates the blood into its components, retains some of the platelets, and returns the remainder of the blood to the donor. \nThis single donor platelet product contains about four to six times as many platelets as a unit of platelets obtained from whole blood. Platelets are used to treat a condition called thrombocytopenia, in which there is a shortage of platelets, and they are also used to treat platelet function abnormalities. Platelets are stored at room temperature with constant agitation for 5 days. \n\nPlasma is the liquid portion of blood – a protein-salt solution in which red and white blood cells and platelets are suspended. Plasma, which is 92 percent water, constitutes 55 percent of blood volume. Plasma contains albumin (the chief protein constituent), fibrinogen (responsible, in part, for the clotting of blood) and globulins (including antibodies). Plasma serves a variety of functions, from maintaining a satisfactory blood pressure and volume to supplying critical proteins for blood clotting and immunity. PlasmaIt also serves as the medium for exchange of vital minerals such as sodium and potassium and helps to maintain a proper pH (acid-base) balance in the body, which is critical to cell function. Plasma is obtained by separating the liquid portion of blood from the cells. \nPlasma is frozen quickly after donation (up to 24 hours) to preserve clotting factors, stored up to one year, and thawed shortly before use. It is commonly transfused to trauma patients and patients with severe liver disease or multiple clotting factor deficiencies. \nPlasma derivatives are concentrates of specific plasma proteins prepared from pools (many donor units) of plasma. Plasma derivatives are obtained through a process known as fractionation. The derivatives are treated with heat and/or solvent detergent to kill certain viruses like those that cause HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. \n\nWhite blood cells (leukocytes) are one of the body’s defenses against disease. Some white cells travel throughout the body and destroy bacteria, some produce antibodies against bacteria and viruses, and others help fight malignant diseases. One’s own “leukocytes” help maintain the body’s immune function, but when present in donated blood, they serve no purpose. In fact, leukocytes may carry viruses that cause immune suppression and release toxic substances in the recipient. Leukocytes can cause a reaction when transfused, and are often removed from the transfusable blood components, a process called leuko-reduction. The majority of white blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, where they outnumber red blood cells by 2 to 1. However, in the blood stream, there are about 600 red blood cells for every white blood cell. There are several different types of white blood cells. \nGranulocytes are one type of several types of white blood cells that are in fact used in more specialized transfusion therapy. Granulocytes and monocytes protect against infection by surrounding and destroying invading bacteria and viruses, and lymphocytes aid in the immune defense system. Granulocytes are prepared by an automated process called apheresis, and must be transfused within 24 hours after collection. They are used for infections that are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. \nAll information courtesy of  ",

        "text": "Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, Magee-Womens Research Institute and UPMC Hillman Cancer Center say they have uncovered new clues for potential improved treatments for breast cancer patients. A research team identified a new genetic change in the estrogen receptor that hinders treatment of breast cancer in some patients.\nThis is the first time that estrogen fusion proteins have been identified in human breast tissue that has led to the understanding how they function. And that finding has the potential to lead to better treatments, the study's senior author said.\n“We think we now have tools to measure changes to tumors that have become resistant to therapy,” said Adrian Lee, director of the Women's Cancer Research at MWRI and the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center.\n“This, however, is really a first step.”\nEstrogen Receptor – ER – breast cancer, which is diagnosed in two-thirds of breast cancer patients, is fueled by the presence of estrogen in the body. Anti-estrogen therapy is usually successful in first treating the disease. But, ER-positive cancers often recur because the cancer develops a resistance to treatment. The estrogen fusion proteins sometimes split in half and eliminate the binding site anti-estrogen therapy targets.\n“Physicians will continue administering anti-estrogen therapy, not realizing this genetic mutation has occurred,” Lee said. “Now that we understand the change, though, we can detect it with a blood test and improve treatments for this form of the disease.”\nLee said the mutation was identified in a patient who had ER-positive breast cancer and received anti-estrogen therapy. The patient's breast cancer recurred and she eventually passed away from the disease.\nA member of Lee's team was performing a posthumous genetic analysis from tissue in UPMC's organ donation program and discovered the mutation, he said.\n“Over time, we were able to identify many more cases of this mutation in patients with recurrent disease,” said Lee, adding that he predicts genetic analysis will soon be the dominant field of ER-positive breast cancer research. And that, in turn, will lead to both improved treatments and survival rates.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, around 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women this year and around 40,920 will die from the disease. It is estimated to cause the death of one out of 38 women. It is the second-leading cause of death in women, only lung cancer kills more.\nThe findinds were published in the Jan. 19 issue of the journal Annals of Oncology.\nSuzanne Elliott is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

        "text": "Exploring the Frontiers of 3D Bioprinting 9 February 2018 | Olivia Warfield \nSince the first human organ transplant was completed in 1954, we’ve come a long way. As ground-breaking as that was at the time, science has developed tremendously in the intervening decades, and bioengineering in the form of 3D printing is on the forefront of new treatment methods for diseases and biological needs. Currently, the medical field encounters a significant number of people who need an organ transplant relative to a small number of organ donations. Supply is nowhere near demand. In the future, experts believe 3D bioprinting will be able to alleviate this problem. 3D printing in the biological realm presents the opportunity to create human cells, tissues, and someday organs through a layering process in which live cells are suspended, similar to the way that 3D models are created through 3D printing. It’s fair to suggest these developments are worth the hype they receive. While the use of 3D bioprinting for complete organs is likely at least a decade or more away, accomplishments so far are impressive and their subsequent implications are promising. Some of the present-day applications and frontiers on the horizon for bioprinting include: Creating Human Organs For Transplant One of the primary ways that bioengineers would like to use 3D printing is for the creation of human organs that could then be transplanted into patients. Cells from the patient would be taken to create the organ. This advancement is still, however, a long way off; researchers currently working on printable human cells predict that custom kidneys, lungs, and hearts might be printable in full in about fifteen to twenty years. The impact this could create for those awaiting organ transplants on years-long waiting lists is beyond spectacular. On a note of hope, Swedish firm Cellink already offers fifteen different active inks with biologically functioning components that can be bought by bodily function. Aiding Facial Reconstruction 3D printed craniofacial reconstruction materials have already benefitted people who have had a facial injury or need repositioning. One commonplace example is the use of Invisalign braces, printed in mass every day as an alternative to adult braces. Penn State researchers found success in 3D printing a nose with considerable accuracy. In China, oral rehabilitation specialists have successfully 3D printed a human tooth. Furthermore, it was implanted into a volunteer patient’s mouth by an autonomous robot surgeon! Bone, cartilage, skin, blood vessels, muscles, and nerves have been created in labs, but more development is needed before it is used on complex structures in patients with regularity. \nCreating Duplicate Tumors The aforementioned organization, Cellink, is also using 3D printing to create duplicate tumors with their biological inks. Cells are taken from the tumors of patients, and those cells are then used to create a duplicate tumor outside of the patient upon which medical researchers can test a variety of treatments with the aim of finding the optimal treatment for that particular patient. No patients have identical cancers, and the implications for this development could maximize the opportunities for highly personalized treatment options that treat and potentially cure patients without direct exposure to therapies that could harm their unique biological composition. The founders of Cellink have gone on to create a tissue printing 3D printer that sells for a low ten grand (US$), practically a steal for such a valuable piece of equipment with powerful potential. They have seen extremely high demand from the onset. Reducing Dependence on Human and Animal Testing By creating testable subjects apart from a human or animal, researchers can reduce the need for controversial, potentially harmful testing procedures while still understanding product efficacy. Animals would, ideally, no longer be needed for testing cosmetics, and other types of tissues for other applications will likely follow. In fact, the startup Organovo has already partnered with cosmetics companies like L'Oréal to test their cosmetics on artificially produced skin tissue. Printing Cartilage-Based Structures Bioprinting has particularly high potential in replacing cartilage based-structures like joints or parts of the knee. Cartilage is rich with opportunity for experimentation as it is only composed of one type of cell and there are no blood vessels within the tissue, which can complicate the process when present. Areas prone to more wear and tear such as hips could have natural tissue replacements. Though the field is still relatively young, cartilage and skin are considered to be the most viable and potentially most widely-used applications for bioprinting technology at present. Constructing Blood Vessels Successfully engineering blood vessels are the key to making tissue and organ implantation successful on a long-term basis. Blood vessels, which are thin and tube-shaped and therefore difficult to print, are needed to supply the implanted tissue or organ with blood that supplies oxygen and nutrients. Blood vessels have been created, but the current challenge is in creating vessels that can be connected to the already-existing veins and arteries. Another challenge is successfully integrating blood vessels into the tissue and organs. However, in 2016, researchers were successfully able to replicate blood vessels in rhesus monkeys. Despite this achievement, it will still be a considerable time before printing vital blood vessels is common practice. 3D printing techniques have already been used to create cost-effective advancements in the health industry. For instance, customized prosthetics are made cheaply and effectively at a more affordable price than prior to the advent of 3D technology. This is beneficial to families with a child who needs prosthetics, because children often grow out of their prosthetics quicker than a family can afford to replace them. Hearing aids are also commonly made using 3D printing technology and they face less regulation and required testing due to their external placement and function. Despite the many strides in 3D bioprinting in the last several decades, there are still a multitude of challenges that need to be faced in order to realize the full potential of the process in the bioengineering sphere. In the meantime, cautious optimism is a safe approach. \nOlivia Warfield is a contributing writer and media relations specialist for American Paper Optics . She writes for a variety of technology and digital development blogs and is especially interested in the rising prominence of 3D technology for business, recreation, and saving lives.

EST February 08, 2018 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nCleveland police are warning area hospitals of a woman they say may be attempting to abduct a newborn child. \nThis same woman, Dawn Brown, and her husband, Cleveland police Officer Ken Brown, are under investigation for making claims that Dawn Brown is pregnant and has terminal cancer. Police do not believe the woman was pregnant nor ill. \nShe has also been the target of online social media scorn from cancer survivors and others who have supported her. \nThe investigation comes after a Jan. 14 \"Blood Drive\" fundraiser held at the Cleveland Police Patrolman's Association (CPPA) hall. \nThe officer abruptly retired Wednesday, a police spokeswoman said. Ken Brown had been assigned to the department's Gang Impact Unit. \nThe flyer for the drive states “Officer Ken Brown and his wife Dawn are expecting their beautiful baby girl Kassidy next month.” Other drives, showers and fundraisers were held in 2017, including one in Vermilion. \nBut it turns Dawn Brown may not be pregnant or physically sick. \nCleveland Clinic’s Fairview Hospital on Wednesday issued a warning to employees about Brown’s “ongoing scam” involving a fake pregnancy. The warning stems from the Cleveland Police Department investigation. \nIt also warns employees that investigators are “concerned that Brown could attempt to try and take a baby from the hospital.” \nCleveland Clinic followed on Thursday with a statement saying: “Based on information we received from the Cleveland Police Department, we have taken extra measures to ensure patients are safe and secure at Fairview Hospital. We take this matter seriously and want to reassure our patients that their safety is our top priority.” \nChannel 3 News first reported the allegations and has since looked into Dawn Brown’s history. She’s made claims of being pregnant with cancer before, and a woman matching her name and description was suspected of scouting local hospital maternity wards in 2001. \nKen Brown had been off-duty for an job-related injury prior to his sudden retirement. He is still being investigated internally. \nA story chronicling Dawn’s history was posted to fightlikeagirlclub.com ( https://www.fightlikeagirlclub.com/dawns-fight-like-a-girl-story-breast-cancer-2/ ) \nIn the November 6th post, Dawn Brown wrote that she’s been battling cancer since she was 16-years-old. She’s now 44-years-old and on her fourth pregnancy. She made claims of speaking in Washington D.C. and garnering support from President Trump and Vice President Pence. \nAt that time, she said she was 26 weeks pregnant and expected to deliver her child on December 15, 2017. The blood drive held for Ken and Dawn by the CPPA was held on January 14, 2018. She has not delivered a baby during that time. \nChannel 3 News located a new baby registry for Ken and Dawn Brown with a Jan. 22, 2018 due date. Many of the items show they’ve already been purchased. \nDawn Brown made similar pregnancy claims in 2016, telling supporters in October of that year that she was carrying twins due on Dec. 15. She later posted that cancer claimed the lives on the unborn children. \nA quick review of Dawn’s history shows her marriage to Ken is at least her 6th, according to court records. They met while shopping for toilet paper at a local Walmart. \nThree divorce cases paint allegations of financial grabs and marital discord. \nOne marriage ended back in 2000, with a court order requiring Dawn be “restrained from abusing, harassing, threatening, molesting and/or striking” her then-husband. \nAnother 2001 divorce proceeding ended with Dawn Brown being ordered to return a baby furniture set and other items to a different husband. \nFinally, a 2005 divorce case shows all issues were resolved after Dawn ended efforts to collect from that husband’s pension or retirement plan. \nChannel 3 News has made several attempts to speak with Dawn Brown to validate her claims of cancer and pregnancy. She hasn’t responded. Her Facebook account has also been removed. \nA friend of Dawn’s refused an on-camera interview, but says she believes her pregnancy claims are true. She “felt the baby kick.” She couldn’t provide an explanation for Dawn not coming forward with proof. \nCleveland Police issued the following statement about the Brown case on Thursday afternoon: \n“The Cleveland Division of Police is currently investigating a complaint of possible fraud being conducted by the wife of a Cleveland Police Officer. The female is suspected of making fraudulent claims regarding her medical condition(s). She is also suspected to have solicited donations via social media with online campaigns. Investigators are still gathering evidence pertaining to the female’s medical records. The Police Officer associated with the case, Kenneth Brown (husband) retired as of February 7, 2018. Area hospitals have issued statements to their employees and patients to be aware of her presence in order to ensure that their patients are safe. Charges have not been filed in this case. The investigation remains ongoing.” ",

I cannot help to view my once great profession with a mixture of sorrow and contempt.” — Peter Langsjoen , MD, Board-certified Cardiologist, discussing the adverse effects of statin drugs that commonly cause serious, difficult-to-detect statin-induced CoQ10 deficiencies in the mitochondria of heart muscle, the central nervous system, and other body tissues. Dr Langsjoen has said that he sees several cases of statin-induced congestive heart failure in his clinical practice each week. \n“It is also noted that instances of pure forms of Alzheimer’s disease, in the absence of other coexistent brain disease processes, such as infarctions or Parkinson’s disease–related lesions, are relatively uncommon.” – – Daniel Perl , MD, Mt Sinai School of Medicine (2010) \n“Establishing mitochondrial toxicity is not an FDA requirement for drug approval, so there is no real way of knowing which agents are truly toxic.” — Dr. Katherine Sims , Mass General Hospital – http://www.mitoaction.org \n“Big Pharma is engaged in the deliberate seduction of the medical profession, country by country, worldwide. It is spending a fortune on influencing, hiring and purchasing academic judgment to a point where, in a few years’ time, if Big Pharma continues unchecked on its present happy path, unbought medical opinion will be hard to find.” – John LeClarre , author of The Constant Gardener, that focused on the corrupt nature of the pharmaceutical industry. \n“Throughout the 20th century, the pharmaceutical industry has been constructed by investors, the goal being to replace effective but non-patentable natural remedies with mostly ineffective but patentable and highly profitable pharmaceutical drugs. The very nature of the pharmaceutical industry is to make money from ongoing diseases. Like other industries, the pharmaceutical industry tries to expand their market — that is to maintain ongoing diseases and to find new diseases for their drugs. Prevention and cure of diseases damages the pharmaceutical business and the eradication of common diseases threatens its very existence.’ — Dr. Matthias Rath – Journal of the American Medical Association, April 15, 1998 \n“Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry fights the eradication of any disease at all costs. The pharmaceutical industry itself is the main obstacle, why today’s most widespread diseases are further expanding including heart attacks, strokes, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, and many others. Pharmaceutical drugs are not intended to cure diseases. According to health insurers, over 24,000 pharmaceutical drugs are currently marketed and prescribed without any proven therapeutic value. According to medical doctors’ associations, the known dangerous side-effects of pharmaceutical drugs have become the fourth leading cause of death after heart attacks, cancer, and strokes.” — Dr Rath (1998) \n“The medical industry research is highly fraudulent–yes, a lie. The CDC knows full well that vaccines cause autism but are in bed with the pharma industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to force people to buy private industry insurance which forces people to use their discretionary income paying for the unaffordable premiums so they will not have the money to pay for holistic forms of healing.” — Blogger at GreenMed Info \n“Medical journals have devolved into information-laundering operations for the pharmaceutical industry. ” — Richard Horton , editor of The Lancet (March 2004) \n‘At least 50% of the articles published in this ever so prestigious journal were not just bad, but downright fraudulent.” — Marcia Angel , MD, who co-edited the New England Journal of Medicine for about 20 years before she was forced out because she questioned the adverse influence of Big Pharma on the NEJM’s editorial policies. \n“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!” – Upton Sinclair , anti-fascist, anti-imperialist American author who wrote in the early 20th century \n“No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable…for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death.” – President Ronald Reagan , as he signed The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986, absolving drug companies from all medico-legal liability when children die or are disabled from vaccine injuries. \n*** \nOver the past several decades there have been a number of well-financed campaigns, sometimes promoted by well-meaning laypersons, to raise public awareness to the plight of patients with physiological, age-related, short-term memory loss – which is not dementia. Suspiciously, most of these campaigns come from “patient advocacy organizations (PAOs) such as the Alzheimer’s Association that has been misleading the public into believing that every memory-loss patient or dementia patient has Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). \nNot so curiously, it turns out that many – perhaps all – of these campaigns have been funded – usually secretly – by the very pharmaceutical companies that can be predicted to benefit financially by promoting the sale of so-called Alzheimer’s drugs (or even vaccinations!). Such corporate-generated public relations “educational campaigns” are increasingly standard procedure for Big Pharma’s drugs, even prior to FDA approval. In other words, many PAOs are primarily front groups for Big Pharma, although many volunteers is such groups are well-meaning and unaware participants. A lot of good can get done in pro-Big Pharma PAOs, if workers watch out for signs of ulterior pro-drug motives. \nBig Pharma has found that the promotion, de-stigmatization and demand for drug therapies for so-called “mental illnesses” are great tools for marketing their drugs. which are touted as being “of unknown etiology” or “inherited” and therefore unpreventable, incurable but “manageable” with the life-long ingestion of cocktails of two or more drugs that have never even been tested in the rat lab, much less in clinical situations. (See this ) \nA year ago, Alzheimer’s support groups – particularly the Big Pharma-subsidized Alzheimer’s Association -aggressively sponsored a documentary that featured the dementia of country singer Glen Campbell. Campbell had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease despite the well-documented fact that Campbell was infamous for his chronic heavy use of brain-damaging, dementia-inducing, addictive, and very neurotoxic drugs like cocaine and alcohol. Therefore, in reality his dementia was most likely caused by his neurotoxic drug abuse which likely was worsened by the fact that he had also used a lot of brain-altering psychotropic prescription drugs simultaneously. Popular performers like Campbell, who are frequently on mentally- and physically-exhausting concert tours, are well-known to over-use chemical cocktails of illicit and legal drugs, which, when used simultaneously, have far worse than additive adverse effects on the body and brain. \nThe experience of the equally early dementia victim and legendary long-term user of illicit brain-altering drugs, Robin Williams, was similar to Campbell in that both used excessive amounts of psychotropic substances that had adverse effects on their brains, livers and psyches. Williams had recently been diagnosed as having Parkinson’s Disease and Lewy Body dementia (both of unknown etiology!). His desperate act of suicide came in the context of newly-prescribed psychiatric drugs that had been prescribed at Minnesota’s Hazelden facility. The prescription drugs were well-known to cause suicidal thinking. \nOver the past several decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the over-prescribing of brain-altering drugs to both adults and children. During the same era there has also been a dramatic increase in the over-vaccinating of mainly infants and children, but also of adults. \nAnd, not coincidentally, during the same era, there have been tens of millions of new dementia victims (“of unknown etiology”) and tens of millions of previously un-heard-of autoimmune disorders, autism spectrum disorders and other chronic illnesses among the over-prescribed and over-vaccinated populations of innocent children. Chronically ingesting brain-altering pills and simultaneously and regularly being injected with neurotoxic vaccines has dire consequences. Big Pharma’s claims of innocence in the face of these epidemics are bald-faced lies. And Big Medicine has been an accomplice in the whole sordid mess. Apologies are in order. \nIatrogenocide? \nThe blatant promotion of largely preventable, iatrogenic disorders does make a lot of money for Big Pharma and Big Medicine, especially if the once-un-conflicted Big Media (the supposed equalizing Fourth Estate) contributes to the mess by consciously preventing open dialogues with the whistle-blowing side of what should be an honest, open, democratic debate. \nTragically, the corporate-dominated media elites appear to have no interest in disturbing the tranquility of the status quo by actually inviting whistle-blowers on to their talk shows. What is going on? I suspect that there is probably too much glad-handing, elbow-rubbing and cross-investing (plus the acceptance of Big advertising that intimidates and silences) going on among the many corporate entities that have too much investment in keeping the status quo going strong. \nHow it Began: Thc Story of Alois Alzheimer \nIn 1910 a German psychiatrist, Alois Alzheimer , published a case history of a single demented and “mentally ill” female patient who had peculiar microscopic findings in her brain at autopsy. In the article he included drawings of what he had seen. The two findings of 1) neurofibrillary tangles and 2) “senile plaques” became the cardinal signs of the disorder that soon was named after him. The peculiar findings are microscopic and therefore only visible at autopsy. Thus the true diagnosis is not a diagnosis that can be accurately made while the patient is still alive. See the information from Harvard below about the differential diagnosis of AD. Alzheimer’s first and only demented patient that he autopsied also showed a loss of 1/3 of the neurons in her cerebral cortex. \nIs the So-called Alzheimer’s Epidemic (of “Unknown Cause”) Actually an Iatrogenic, Drug-and Vaccine-Induced Epidemic That the Medical Profession and Big Pharma are Desperately Trying to Cover Up? \nThe likely answer to that question is yes, and you could say the same thing about the twin epidemics of autistic spectrum disorders and chronic autoimmune disorders among fully vaccinated children in the First World. \nSynchronous with the fast-paced over-vaccination agendas over the past several decades that the Big Pharma-, Big Medicine- and Big Business-dominated “first world”, careful, un-blinded, non-conflicted observers are witnessing and documenting the following inconvenient realities: \n1) There are huge increases in childhood and adult vaccinations that have intramuscularly-injected neurotoxic, blood-brain barrier-destroying ingredients such as aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, glutamate and live viruses; \n2) There is the widespread and chronic use of cocktails of psychotropic drugs that are known to cause brain damage, destruction of the blood-brain barrier, mitochondrial toxicity and dementia; \n3) There is the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs (which also lower the essential, energy-supplying, vitamin-like substance CoQ10) which are known to also cause memory loss, depression and mitochondrial toxicity; \n4) There is the ingestion of the neurotoxic substances fluoride and lead that are contaminating many municipal drinking water supplies; \n5) There is the wide-spread ingestion of a large variety of toxic and poorly-nourishing food additives that Big Food has put in our Standard American Diet (SAD), such as dyes, NutraSweet, Splenda, trans-fat-containing oils and margarines, MSG, etc, plus toxic contaminants such as Round-Up, genetically-modified substances, livestock antibiotics and other poisonous chemicals that are in virtually all non-organic food; and \n6) ETC, ETC, ETC. \nNot coincidentally, there has also been a large parallel increase in the following clusters of disorders: the alarming and increasing incidence of chronic diseases, autoimmune disorders of childhood and autistic spectrum disorders (see this ); b) the alarming increase in the diagnoses of mental illnesses and dementias of supposedly “unknown origin”. \nBoth of those categories are conveniently – and falsely – being blamed on “genetics” by the various guilty parties that are actually at least partially responsible. And, it must be noted: there is no credible evidence for claiming any of the above have genetic causes. \nDisease entities that have no confirmatory lab tests include such disorders as ASD, Asperger’s, Learning Disorders, ADHD, OCD, Bipolar Disorder, Gulf War Syndrome, “mental illnesses of unknown etiology”, etc, etc. These diagnoses, supposedly of “unknown etiology” are multifactorial realities which, via clever marketing efforts and the studied ignorance of what is actually known about their actual root causes, are being blindly treated with brain-altering chemicals that have no chance of curing anything – including the so-called Alzheimer’s Disease. \nIt is important to ask and then demand an honest answer to this important question: “Could there be any connection between our nation’s increasingly common over-prescribing of immunotoxic, neurotoxic, mitochondrial-toxic, blood-brain barrier-toxic, synthetic prescription drugs and the CDC and AAP-blessed over-vaccination agendas that are so commonly mandated for disorders that supposedly “have no known cause”? Any grade schooler would respond to that question by rolling their eyes and saying “well of course!” \nCould the economically disabling (indeed bankrupting) American epidemic of supposedly “disorders of unknown origin” be found to have recognizable root causes and therefore be curable and, most importantly, preventable, rather than chronically “managed” with unaffordable, disease-inducing prescription drugs that will have to be monitored, changed, renewed or have their dosages adjusted at monthly office visits for the rest of their drug-sickened lives. \nThe above are extremely important questions, especially in the case of America’s chronic disease epidemics. There are many so-called patient advocacy organizations (PAO) that are heavily funded by major for-profit, corporations that are not donating money out of the goodness of their cold hearts. Such Big Pharma-supported PAOs go to great lengths to hide the financial support they get from their foundations, sugar daddies and assorted investors. \nThere are hundreds of PAOs that have ulterior motives, and there are many altruistic ones that are barely surviving on shoe string budgets that depend on small donations. The latter PAOs are trying to do the right thing and do not take money from big corporations that are in the game for the money. PAOs like the Alzheimer’s Association, NAMI, MakeItOK, and the American Parkinson Disease Association take a lot of money from Big Businesses and some pretty nefarious Big Money foundations. The leadership of that kind of PAO acts like they are totally unaware of (or willfully ignorant about) the fact that many prescription drugs, especially psychotropic drugs, ARE known to be both dependency-inducing AND a potential cause of irreversible brain damage. \nLong-term use of such neurotoxic, psychoactive drugs would be easily expected to worsen any number of neurological (and therefore psychological) disorders because of the brain cell death that easily happens when enough brain cell mitochondria have been wounded or killed off. (Note: See the info on drugs and mitochondria farther below.) \nOne of the big problems in America’s corporate-controlled culture, media and medical industries is that the giant pharmaceutical corporations, who are in the business of developing, marketing and profiting from their known-to-be toxic drugs and vaccines have a special interest in pretending that there is no known preventable or curable causes for the disorders for which they have products to sell you. \nWe have all heard the following common and very dis-informational ruse – which is both unproven and simplistic: We are told – by those who want to sell us a drug or vaccine, that “the problem that you have is probably genetic”, implying that the disorder is neither-preventable nor curable. The implication is that the current epidemic of iatrogenic disorders such as the opioid epidemic (“iatrogenic”=”doctor-caused, treatment-caused or prescription drug-caused”) is not the responsibility of Big Pharma’s or Big Medicine’s toxic products or vaccines! And we lemmings, both the drug swallowers and the drug prescribers, to our great shame, all-too-often don’t question the obvious lie. \nIt should be a concern for everyone who knows or treats demented or Parkinsonian patients, that the most powerful and wealthy and well-staffed PAOs are known to be front groups for the giant pharmaceutical companies that profit handsomely from any number of virtually useless (and definitely not curative) drugs for dementia such as Pfizer’s Aricept, Novartis’s Exelon, Eli Lilly’s Namenda, and Janssen’s Razadyne. \nInterestingly, Pfizer announced last month that they were abandoning their increasingly attempts to search for and test new drugs for Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease. They closed the research branches for both classes of disease. Pfizer saw that they were throwing good money after bad, having already wasted billions of dollars on what they now recognize as a futile search for new drugs. Such searches are still being pursued by many other pharma companies – for now. Pfizer’s stock dropped $4 a share on the announcement. \nBut both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s are neurodegenerative disorders whose hallmarks involve permanent brain damage of certain brain areas. Knowing that both diseases are caused by permanent and irreversible brain damage, how any investor could have thought that a chemical or vaccine could have been effective as treatment or cure is beyond me. \nHowever, knowing how cunning these Big Pharma corporations are, I suspect that Pfizer, in the case of their Aricept drug , still made a ton of money selling it. It should come as no surprise to anyone that we prescribing physicians are as bamboozled by the prevalent corporate pseudoscience and Big Pharma’s fraudulent advertising as are our patients, whether the commercials come at us from television, magazines, journals or attractive female drug detail reps who come bearing pens, pizzas and post-it notes. \nThe BBC reported a few days ago that there were over 100 clinical trials currently being done on Alzheimer’s drugs around the world, but that “more than 99% of trials for Alzheimer’s drugs have failed in the past 15 years.” So, if you are waiting for a cure, don’t hold your breath. Pfizer likely made a smart move. Expect other drug companies to follow suit soon. \nPrescription Drug-Induced – and Vaccine-Induced – Mitochondrial Disorders \nAs opposed to the rare “primary” or congenital mitochondrial disorders like muscular dystrophy, “acquired” mitochondrial disorders are often caused by commonly prescribed drugs and/or vaccine. They are also generally poorly understood and therefore difficult to diagnose by busy health practitioners. Also – naturally – iatrogenic disorders are rarely made by the physician whose treatment caused the disorder. \nWhen I went to med school, even my professors knew anything about the lethal effects that drugs and vaccines could do to mitochondria, – or even normal brain cells, for that matter. There weren’t that many toxic drugs or vaccines (albeit many of them contained mercury) that could be prescribed back in the good old days. I recall that the function, physiology-and microanatomy of mitochondria were poorly understood back in those years, although our professors did try to teach us med students something about the incomprehensible and soon-forgotten Kreb’s cycle. \nMitochondrial research, especially in the last few decades, has proven the cause and effect relationship between a variety of commonly prescribed medications and vaccines and mitochondrial disorders. That evidence seems to have been cunningly covered-up by the for-profit pharma groups (who control what gets taught in med schools, published in their medical journals or what gets presented at their continuing education courses. Big Pharma appears to even have control over what gets discussed in the mainstream media, especially what is offered to readers by the basically undiscerning “health and science” journalists who do not know much about basic medicine, neuroscience, neurochemistry or micronutrition. \nVarious other powers-that-be are involved educating most of us because of the serious economic consequences that might happen if any negative information (like what you are reading hers) was allowed in the popular press. The profit-seeking stake-holders in the pharmaceutical and medical industries, most of whom profit mightily from the routine and increasing use of neurotoxic drugs and vaccines would be very displeased if the preceding or following information got out. I submit that Big Pharma’s cover-up of the connections between their drugs and drug-induced disorders is totally unethical and, in the opinion of many whistleblowers, criminal. \nAn Honest Patient Guide for Dementia Patients (from Harvard!) \nSo I was pleasantly surprised to recently find a reasonably honest guide for dementia patients on a Harvard University website. These suggestion, contrary to the vast majority of Big Pharma’s products, are compatible with the Hippocratic Oath. (The entire guide can be accessed here .) \nThe information at the Harvard site stated that there were over 50 conditions that could cause or mimic the symptoms of dementia. In other words, there are over 50 conditions that could be mis-diagnosed as Alzheimer’ dementia. I hadn’t been taught anything about that reality when I went to med school, and I doubt that many of my physician colleagues had either. And besides, what medical practitioner in our over-busy, double-booked clinic environment, even if he or she was aware, has the time to thoroughly rule out the 50 conditions when confronted with a patient with memory loss? It’s simpler to just call every case of dementia Alzheimer’s! And nobody ever questions such an authoritative-sounding diagnosis, even though the only definitive way to confirm the diagnosis is at autopsy. \nI have often said to my patients and folks who attend my seminars: “it takes only 2 minutes to write a prescription, but it takes 20 minutes to not write a prescription”. And in the current for-profit clinic culture, time is money and few physicians are given the “luxury” of spending adequate time with their patients. (In defense of the physicians that I know, they are not happy about that reality but don’t know what to do about it.) \nIt is so tempting to use the popularized, but rather squishy label of Alzheimer’s rather than to educate ourselves about the possibility of drug- or vaccine-induced dementia. But what is so important is that many of the 50+ conditions are preventable or reversible, which will be therapeutic only if the conditions are identified before more brain damage from drug-induced or environmental-poison-induced neurotoxicity occurs. \nThe Harvard guide actually said that \n“medications are common culprits in mental decline. With aging, the liver becomes less efficient at metabolizing drugs, and the kidneys eliminate them from the body more slowly. As a result, drugs tend to accumulate in the body. Elderly people in poor health and those taking several different medications are especially vulnerable.” \nThe guide continued with a list of the possible classes of prescription drugs that number in the hundreds: \n“The list of drugs that can cause dementia-like symptoms is long. It includes antidepressants, antihistamines, anti-Parkinson drugs, anti-anxiety medications, cardiovascular drugs, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, narcotics, sedatives.” \nThe Harvard guide went on to emphasize that Alzheimer’s can only be accurately diagnosed on a post-mortem examination. The guide states that \n“Alzheimer’s is distinguished from other dementias at autopsy by the presence of sticky beta-amyloid plaques outside brain cells (neurons) and fibrillary tangles within neurons (all indicative of cellular death). Although such lesions may be present in any aging brain, in people with Alzheimer’s these lesions tend to be more numerous and accumulate in areas of the brain involved in learning and memory.” \n“The leading theory is that the damage to the brain results from inflammation and other biological changes that cause synaptic loss and malfunction, disrupting communication between brain cells. Eventually the brain cells die, causing tissue loss and cell carcasses or scars. In imaging scans, brain shrinkage is usually first noticeable in the hippocampus, which plays a central role in memory function.” \nBut even the Harvard guide inexplicably failed to mention known mitochondrial toxins such as statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs such as Pfizer’s Lipitor), metformin, Depakote, general anesthetics, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, fluorinated psychotropic drugs (like many of the SSRIs and the so-called antipsychotics). \nBig Food and Big Vaccine Corporations are Guilty of Causing Chemical Brain Trauma \nAnd here is some more information about the mitochondrial toxins that have gone unrecognized in our environment: This information must be understood, because alone, there may not be huge risks, but in combination with other toxins, they will have additive, if not synergistic (multiplier) adverse effects. \nFor example, the artificial sweetener NutraSweet (aspartame) is in hundreds of food products and diet sodas that are sold in non-organic food stores. Every molecule of the artificial chemical, when it reaches 86 degrees F [body temp is 98.6 F], releases one molecule of the excitotoxin aspartic acid, one molecule of the adrenalin precursor phenylalanine and one molecule of the cellular toxin methanol [wood alcohol]. Methanol rapidly metabolizes into the known Class A carcinogen and mitochondrial poison formaldehyde [embalming fluid]). Another toxic metabolite of aspartame is diketopiperazine (DKP) which when “nitrosated” in the gut, produces a compound which is similar to N-Nitrosourea, a powerful brain tumor-causing chemical. \nThe tri-chlorinated sucrose molecule that is sold as another artificial sweetener is called Splenda (sucralose). The synthetic chemical has been marketed as an insecticide in China) and is in many food products. I killed an entire colony of ants in my garden overnight by sprinkling some Splenda on the soil. I then had no idea about how to decontaminate my ant-free garden from the Splenda poisoning. \nThe above are only a small number of the synthetic chemicals that are capable of causing mitochondrial damage in brain cells – damage that can cause memory loss, confusion and cognitive dysfunction, all early symptoms of dementia. \nIn summary, it must be regarded as tragic, but all–too-common, for reversible and preventable drug-induced dementias to be mis-diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease “of unknown etiology” and then quickly and reflexively mis-treated with costly, essentially worthless drugs, whose mitochondrial toxicities are ignored. \n(The pharmaceutical industry, it should be noted, is not required by the FDA to test its drugs for mitochondrial toxicity, again exhibiting the total disdain for the Precautionary Principle by both industry and the regulatory agencies such as the FDA and the CDC.) \nThere is much more in the basic neuroscience literature that has been written by un-bought scientists who do not have conflicts of interest with Big Pharma and Big Medicine, that offer proof of the connections mentioned above. The authors of these research and clinical articles have raised the questions and have published the proof that concerned families of patients and their physicians desperately need to know. Sadly, these authors are often black-listed from the major medical or scientific journals that take advertising money from Big Pharma or whose peer reviewers have been co-opted by Big Pharma money or influence. \nDon’t expect Big Pharma to respond or to offer apologies or admit to their unethical (or sometimes criminal) behaviors. Do expect denials, delays, dismissals, distractions, or the attempts to discredit the un-biased scientific evidence that exposes subterfuge in the name of maintaining large profits for Big Pharma’s or Big Medicine’s stakeholders. \nHere are the abstracts from just two of the many peer-reviewed journal articles that have been published in any number of science journals that support the thesis of this column. \n* \nGary G.

        "text": "Search this site: Grab and IFRC call for solidarity with people in need through Southeast Asia's largest loyalty programme Grab \n• Partnership with Grab is IFRC’s first fundraising initiative globally using a smart phone app • Grab customers can convert GrabRewards points to a donation to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) • Following earlier 2016 partnership, the organisations continue to find innovative ways to respond to emergencies and disasters \nSingapore, 6 February 2018 --( ASIA TODAY )-- Grab and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) today announced a partnership to raise additional funds for supporting vulnerable communities, including those affected by disasters. The collaboration between the world’s largest humanitarian network and Southeast Asia’s leading on-demand transportation and mobile payments platform will enable Grab users to convert their points into donations to the IFRC. Allowing donations via smartphone app is a first globally for the IFRC. This is the the next chapter of Grab and the IFRC working together to find innovative ways to support the disaster-prone Southeast Asian region, following an earlier partnership in 2016. \n“Southeast Asia is one of the world’s most vulnerable regions for disasters while a wide number of people are still struggling to access food, safe water, health services or basic livelihoods. Working together with the Red Cross and Red Crescent to fund their programmes and help people in crisis or despair echoes our mission to drive Southeast Asia forward. Grab wants to stand together with IFRC in responding to disasters and making vulnerable people more resilient. Using GrabRewards as a platform makes donating as easy as a tap on your phone. The points our passengers earn from their rides will now give them not just access to a wide range of retail and lifestyle products, but also create a deeper sense of purpose with every ride that they take with Grab,” said Jason Thompson, Managing Director, GrabPay Southeast Asia. \nFrom 31 January onwards, Grab users in Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam can visit their GrabRewards catalogue and convert their points into donations, with just a tap on their everyday app. Grab customers in Singapore can do a donation starting at 5 SGD in exchange for 2,200 GrabRewards points. \nPierre Kremer, IFRC Head of Partnerships for Asia Pacific said, “Grab’s history as a homegrown tech company and its extensive reach across Southeast Asia make it a natural partner for the IFRC. This is the first time we’ve partnered with a smartphone app to raise funds. We have in common a commitment to expand people-to-people connections and solidarity and contribute to build resilient communities, cities and countries. This is the commitment of the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and hundreds of thousands of volunteers working within communities in need. We are excited to work with Grab to explore new ways to tackle suffering and demonstrate the power of humanity in Southeast Asia.” \nThe IFRC will redistribute each country’s donation to the local Red Cross or Red Crescent Society, for use on that country’s most pressing humanitarian challenges. Programmes include disaster risk reduction, improving safe water supplies, responding to volcanic eruptions, floods, cyclones or typhoons or epidemics, encouraging voluntary blood donations, and enhancing the protection of marginalised or vulnerable groups such as children or migrants. \nThe organisations have previously explored innovative ways of working together. In 2016, Grab and the IFRC engaged in a one-year partnership to promote road safety, provide emergency assistance and equip Grab’s fleet of drivers with life-saving skills and road safety knowledge across the region. The partnership upskilled Grab drivers with first aid and road safety techniques and drew on Grab’s driver fleets and call centres as a first-responder network during disaster and emergency situations. \n### \nAbout Grab Grab is Southeast Asia’s leading on-demand transportation and mobile payments platform. Grab solves critical transportation challenges to make transport freedom a reality for 620 million people in Southeast Asia. Grab’s core product platform includes transport solutions for drivers and passengers with an emphasis on convenience, safety and reliability, as well as its proprietary mobile payments platform, GrabPay, which is increasing access to mobile payment solutions for millions of Grab riders and drivers across Southeast Asia and deepening financial inclusion in the region.

A student getting dental check up at the mobile dental clinic during the state-level dental care event at SMJK Choong Hua Bidor. \nHe said about 3% of those aged between 13 and 17 in the state were smokers. \n“Out of the 177,593 youths in the state, about 5,000 of them smoke. Nearly 700 of them have registered with our Quit Smoking Clinic with 219 having successfully kicked away the bad habit,” he said. \nAs for diabetes, Dr Mah said, according to the National Diabetic Registry, there are 146,591 patients in the state. Students performing a traditional dance during the opening ceremony of the state level dental care programme at SMJK Choong Hua, Bidor. \n“About 6.6% or 9,626 have retinopathy, which means there are problems with their blood vessels, which could then lead to other complications like vision loss,” he added. \nDr Mah said the Health Ministry will continue to beef up awareness campaigns to promote dental healthcare to the public. \n“The people too, must also be vigilant about their own health and to look after themselves properly,” he said.

        "text": "Read This Heart op saves Doncaster boy, aged two James, Henry and Megan Cook, are raising money for the Children's Heart Surgery Fund at Leeds General Infirmary, where Henry has heart surgery. David Kessen Published: 09:01   \nToday he is a smiling toddler who loves to play with his brother and sister at the family home in Doncaster. \nBut for two-year-old Henry Cook, life has been a struggle after he was born with three holes in his heart and a valve that was narrower than it should be. Now, after receiving major treatment from a Yorkshire hospital, his family has drawn up plans to raise money to help future heart patients. Henry Cook at the time of his operation \nHenry was born a month early, after doctors had initially raised concerns about his heart being bigger then they had expected. But at first, experts thought he would not have a problem. \nBut by the time Henry was six months old, issues had become clear. His feet and hands looked blue to his family, and there was often a blue colouring around his lips. He was lethargic and coughed at night. His mum and dad were worried, but doctors had been unable to find a problem. \nWhen he had medical checks aged six months, he had another scan. This time, the medics found two holes in his heart and a pulmonary stenosis - the narrowing of the valve that lets blood flow from the heart to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. \nDoctors at Doncaster Royal Infirmary immediately called in an expert consultant from Leeds General Infirmary children's heart unit. After consultation with a surgeon, arrangements were made for an operation. Doctors wanted to leave it as long as they could so that Henry was older and stronger, and better able to withstand the operation. \nFor mum and dad Megan and James Cook, who also have two older children, Lily, 10, and Finley, five, it was a terrible time. But they got through with help from the Children's Heart Surgery Fund - the charity which works with the Leeds hospital to raise money to help the unit and its patients. \nMegan, aged 30 said: \"My fear was losing him, knowing how bad to was. They made it clear before the operation that he could go into cardiac arrest. I couldn't even sign the consent form, because I was shaking too much - James had to do that.\" \nDoctors expected to operate for four hours - but it took seven hours after they found a third hold in Henry's heart. From then on the couple kept a constant vigil at Henry's bedside, each doing four hours at a time, until he finally reopened his eyes. \nAfter a quick recovery, he was allowed to leave the hospital and return to the family home on Bawtry Road, Bessacarr. \nSix weeks later, he went back for a post operative check. \n\"I cried when they did the scan, and I could see that finally everything was working as it should,\" said Megan. \n\"Henry will need check-ups and he will need an operation every 10 years to replace his valve. There will be things he can't do - he can't do swimming, play contact sports, or go on roller coasters. \n\"But if was not for the help of the Heart Surgery Fund, I don't know how we would have managed. They did so much for us.\" \nNow Henry's family is raising money for the Children's Heart Surgery Fund, in a bid to thank its staff for all they did. Throughout Henry's stay at the hospital, Megan and James said the charity was there for them, from its staff helping them settle in when they first arrived, to providing accommodation where they could stay while their son was in hospital. \nJames had organised a charity ghost hunt at the Punch's Hotel, on Bawtry Road, on February 24. The hotel has provided the venue for free. Tickets are priced £30. Contact James on 01302 532115 or on Facebook at James \"psychic medium\" cook. \nHe is also offering to do readings for a donation to the charity. \nLog onto chsf.org.uk and follow the donate link.

        "text": "You don’t need a reason to donate blood. But if you did, Dave Caine has two.\nBoth his grandfather and his stepfather suffered from leukemia. His grandfather succumbed to the illness. His stepfather beat it and has been in remission for 11 years. Caine donates not only blood but blood platelets, which cancer patients often need, to honor his relatives.\nCaine, of Hanover Township, Northampton County, is one of several people who reached out to me after reading my column a few weeks ago recounting how I started donating blood again after more than a decade of sitting on the sidelines. He thanked me for getting the word out and agreed to share his story to inspire people to donate platelets, too.\n“It’s definitely something that’s needed,” he told me Thursday over lunch in Bethlehem.\nPlatelets are cells that play an important role in controlling bleeding and bruising. Some cancer patients require daily platelet transfusions for several weeks because they become anemic and lose platelets during their treatments, according to the Miller-Keystone Blood Center’s website.\nCaine said his stepfather, Don Goldstein, went through that. He recalled hearing stories about how “every day he’s getting a unit of platelets.”\nPlatelets also are important for burn and accident victims, heart surgery patients, organ and bone marrow transplant patients, premature babies and others.\nCaine remembers his father donating platelets and he followed his lead. But it took on a new meaning when Goldstein was diagnosed with leukemia, a cancer of blood cells.\n“With Don, that kind of strengthened the reason why I want to do it,” Caine said.\nPlatelets can be donated more frequently than blood and Caine tries to give every eight weeks. He said as he’s leaving the Miller-Keystone Blood Center, he’ll call Goldstein — whom he refers to as his “bonus dad” instead of as his stepfather — to tell him he donated again and was thinking of him.\n“It’s a little sappy,” he said.\nHe doesn’t know much about his grandfather, Murray Caine. He died when Caine’s father was 2. But he donates in his honor as well.\nDonating platelets is different than donating blood. It takes longer, 90 minutes to two hours. An automated system known as apheresis separates your blood into its components — red blood cells, platelets and plasma. Your platelets are collected while your red blood cells and plasma are returned to your body.\nOur bodies reproduce platelets rapidly, so donors can give every eight days, instead of every 56 days for whole blood donations. There is a limit of 24 platelet donations a year, according to Miller-Keystone Blood Center’s website.\nPlatelets have a short shelf life, though, and last only five days. So donors always are needed.\nPaul Muschick I donated blood this week for the first time in a long time. Way too long.\nFor several years, I was a regular donor. It was something I started after 9/11, when giving blood was considered a patriotic thing to do in case it was needed to treat survivors of those terrorist attacks or future ones.\n... I donated blood this week for the first time in a long time. Way too long.\nFor several years, I was a regular donor. It was something I started after 9/11, when giving blood was considered a patriotic thing to do in case it was needed to treat survivors of those terrorist attacks or future ones.\n... (Paul Muschick) If you missed my column last month, I recounted how I was a regular blood donor when I lived in North Carolina but didn’t keep it up after moving to Pennsylvania in 2004. I meant to get back in the game and finally did after hearing about a program to recruit donors at Miller-Keystone.\nThe center started a marketing campaign to increase the number of donors with rare blood traits. That means they aren’t just A, B or O, but that their blood has unique qualities such as red cells that lack certain antigens. The blood center’s goal is to diversify the supply with donations from various racial and ethnic groups so it better matches the region’s demographics.\nDiversifying the blood supply would especially help people with sickle cell disease, which affects blacks, Hispanics and people of Middle Eastern, Asian, Indian and Mediterranean descent at higher rates. They often need transfusions because their blood cells can become stiff, sticky and hard, blocking vessels and causing pain.\nI don’t have rare blood, but every donation counts.\nCaine wasn’t the only person I heard from after my column. A few others also thanked me for getting the word out, including a Breinigsville man who, like me, had been a regular donor while living elsewhere but stopped after moving to the Lehigh Valley. My story motivated him to start giving again. I hope others started, too.\nCaine said that every once in a while, he’ll get a call from Miller-Keystone asking if he will donate platelets because of an urgent need. And he obliges.\nHe does all this despite the fact he hates needles. Not just hates them, but hates them so much that he once left a movie theater after watching a scene involving one.\nIf he can get over that fear to make a difference in the lives of others, you can, too.\nYou can schedule a blood donation at 800-223-6667 or giveapint.org .\npaul.muschick@mcall.com\n610-820-6582\nPaul Muschick’s columns are published Monday through Friday at themorningcall.com and Sunday, Wednesday and Friday in The Morning Call.

Surgeon and nurse suture patient (Image: Getty) \nThis figure represents just 15.8 people per million population donating organs during that year - the lowest in England. \nThe report showed that people in the North-West gave the highest number of organs - 162, representing 22.6 per million inhabitants.

Doctor in operating theatre (Image: Getty) \nThe grateful 24-year-old said: “Organ donation is an incredible act of kindness. \n“In 2011 my life was saved thanks to my amazing donor and her family, who agreed to fulfil my donor’s wish to donate in the event of death. \n“Struggling to breathe due to Cystic Fibrosis, my lung transplant gave me the chance to graduate from university, jump out of a plane and enjoy every moment life gives. \n“Without organ donation I would have died at 18 years old. “I urge everyone who has the desire to sign up to the register, to do so and please share your wishes with your loved ones.” \nEscape the bleak winter by jetting off for £60 or less this month from East Midlands Airport \nThe statistics were revealed in research carried out for the fitness experts Nuyoo, using the NHS Organ Donation and Transplantation Activity Report for 2016/17. \nThe same survey revealed that the number of deceased organ donors rose to 1,413, a four percent increase on the previous year . \nIn addition, there were 1,043 living donors. \nThis saw 753 live-saving and life-transforming transplants being performed by surgeons. \nIt was also revealed that the NHS succeeded in reaching a milestone figure, with 50,000 people alive today thanks to a transplant. \nHowever, there were 6,388 patients waiting for a life-saving transplant in 2017. Kidneys are important for blood purification in the body (Image: Getty) \nSadly, 457 patients died while waiting for their transplant on the active list, while 875 were removed from the list altogether. \nThe removals were mostly due to deteriorating health and ineligibility for transplant – with many of these patients passing away shortly after. \nThe statistics were revealed in research carried out for fitness experts Nuyoo , using the NHS Organ Donation and Transplantation Activity Report for 2016/17. \nThe North West was found to donate the most kidneys and cardiothoracic organs. \nWhile pancreas donation numbers are highest in the West Midlands, the East of England is highest for liver donations.

        "text": "By Daniel J. Roth February 9, 2018 13:58 The purpose of the film is break stereotypes of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community and show them as a real human beings instead of a reclusive, marginal group. 3 minute read. Share on facebook Share on twitter MEN SEARCH the cloak room for their jackets at a mass gathering of Satmar Hassidim in New York. (photo credit: REUTERS) \nNEW YORK –A documentary about altruistic kidney donation is shining a fresh light on New York’s ultra-Orthodox community few have seen before.Titled Match Made in Heaven , the film tells the heartwarming story of how two Jews from opposite sides of the world formed a bond literally through blood and greatness of spirit.   As 68-year-old New Jersey native David Solomon resigned himself to daily dialysis treatments last year, he wondered if he’d live long enough to see his daughter get married.“Kidney disease will definitely kill you,” he said during the film, produced by the Orthodox outreach group Jew in the City. “The alternative to this was eventually dialysis, whether it be hemo or peritoneal... I was prepared to make the best of it no matter which way it went.”His blood type made matters worse: Solomon is O positive, meaning that although he can donate to anyone, he can only be the recipient of O positive donations.“Which means on the [kidney transplant] list, I’m the last person to get it.”Having lost both his parents to renal failure, the Conservative Jew from Newark understood the gravity of his ailment.Running out of options, the family turned to Renewal, a nonprofit organization based in Brooklyn that facilitates altruistic kidney donations, hoping to find a match.“Dave came into the organization like any other patient,” Rabbi Josh Sturm, Renewal’s director of outreach, told The Jerusalem Post in a phone conversation on Thursday.Founded in 2006 by members of the Borough Park hassidic community, Sturm said the vast majority of the donors are Orthodox, and “of the Orthodox donors, the majority of them are hassidic.“In fact, of all the altruistic kidney donations [people donating to strangers] done in the last eight years in the US, 15% were donated by Orthodox Jews, even though we are only 0.2% of the US,” he said.The organization noted that it facilitated 81 transplants last year and more than 400 since its inception 12 years ago.The rabbi said that after receiving Solomon’s medical files and conducting a few tests of their own, they began searching their database for a possible donor with the same blood type.Meanwhile, Yosef Leib Bornstein, 42, a member of the Ger Hassidic sect who grew up in the UK, had begun to hear of Renewal through its community outreach program in his adoptive Brooklyn neighborhood.After attending a number of meetings organized by Renewal, and after overcoming some initial fears, Bornstein said that his faith and commitment to helping his fellow man finally convinced him to act.“All our life we learned that to save someone’s life, it’s like you save the whole world,” Bornstein says in the film. “People want to do something, even if it’s really hard... It’s about saving someone’s life.”When test results came back matching Bornstein and Solomon together, the later insisted on meeting the man who was willing to put his own life in danger to save his.“You’re part of my family now,” the short film catches Solomon telling Bornstein just hours before the procedure.“You’re actually going to have a part of my family in you,” Bornstein jokingly responds.According to Jew in the City, the film is meant to break stereotypes of the Orthodox community and show its members as a real human beings instead of a reclusive, marginal group not willing to interact with modern society.“We only see hassidic Jews abusing people and being insular,” the filmmakers told the Post in an email. “There are so many wonderful acts of kindness being done in the hassidic world that no one ever hears about. We were excited to share just one of these stories.“When we brainstorm ideas... a couple years ago we had the idea to do a story from Renewal,” they continued. “They are doing these donations all the time, but we thought it would be the most dramatic to show a hassidic Jew giving to a non-Orthodox Jew, because it wasn’t just an act of kindness there, it would show that the perception that hassidic Jews only care about their own is not the complete picture.”On July 7, 2017, footage from Rebecca Solomon’s wedding was added to the Match Made in Heaven documentary, with the guest of honor being Yousef Bornstein. And to show her gratitude for her husband’s life being saved, Salomon’s wife, Gail, recently donated one of her kidneys too. You can learn more about Renewal’s work by going to www.renewal.org.

The free event runs from 8:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. at the hospital’s campus, located at 3015 N. Ballas Road. \nThe Heart Fair will include a number of health screenings available at no cost to attendees, including blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose level, BMI and body composition measurement. For those identified through these tests as being at high risk for heart disease, stroke or diabetes, Missouri Baptist will provide follow-up services at several points during the year, focused on assisting those individuals with health management and lifestyle changes as well as connecting them to necessary medical resources to help them lower their risk. \nIn addition to screenings, the family-friendly event will include live heart-healthy cooking demonstrations and free food samples from Dierbergs; exercise classes including yoga and Tai Chi; health presentations by physicians, and a number of interactive activities for families and kids. A blood donation drive to benefit the American Red Cross also will be held. \nAdvanced registration for the Heart Fair, as well as for the free health screenings, is recommended by visiting missouribaptist.org/HeartFair. \nCDC declares flu epidemic, issues updated treatment guidelines \nThis year’s nasty flu season recently prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] to declare a nationwide epidemic. Unfortunately, flu statistics show Missouri to be the hardest-hit state in the country, with more than 40,000 cases reported so far. In St. Louis County, the flu definitely has reached widespread levels – for the week ending Jan. 14 alone, 1,074 cases were reported countywide, although that number was down slightly from the 1,282 cases reported during the first week in January. \nAccording to both the CDC and local lab test results, influenza A – more specifically, the A[H3N2] virus – has been the predominant strain circulating this season. In the past, this strain has been associated with more hospitalizations and deaths than other subtypes of the flu, especially in young children and those over age 65. At the same time, vaccine effectiveness against H3N2 has proven to be lower compared to other flu strains. \nFor those reasons, the CDC stated, the use of antiviral medications for treatment of influenza is extremely important this year. These medications, called neuraminidase inhibitors, include Oseltamivir [Tamiflu], Zanamivir [Relenza], Laninamivir [Inavir] and Peramivir [Rapivab]. \nThey are most effective in treating and reducing serious complications from the flu when started soon after symptoms begin – within 36 to 48 hours, if possible. However, data from previous flu seasons suggests that these medications have not been fully utilized in outpatients and hospitalized patients with influenza. Therefore, the CDC recommended that all patients in high-risk categories should be started on an antiviral medication as soon as possible after they become ill, even before test results confirming the flu are available. Although the medications work best when started within two days of the onset of flu symptoms, they still can be of some help when started later in the illness, which may last for two weeks or more. \nMigraine surgery may offer dramatic benefits \nThose who suffer from migraine headaches can attest to their debilitating symptoms: severe throbbing or pulsating pain, generally on just one side of the head, which is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Over the past several years, migraine surgery has been available as a potential treatment for people whose severe migraines don’t respond well to medications. Developed by plastic surgeons who noticed that some migraine patients had fewer headaches after undergoing cosmetic forehead lifts, migraine surgery uses one of several techniques to relieve pressure on the nerves that trigger migraines. People whose migraine headaches don’t respond to conventional treatments may benefit from a plastic surgery procedure. \nA new study, published recently in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery ® , used a pain survey called the Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire [PSEQ] to evaluate the effectiveness of migraine surgical procedures. It provides information not only on pain scores, but also on functional disability and ability to cope with pain when performing normal daily activities. \nThe study included 90 patients who underwent migraine surgery between 2013 and 2015. Before and after surgery, patients were evaluated with a standard migraine questionnaire [the Migraine Headache Inventory, or MHI] and with the PSEQ. Before surgery, the patients had generally “extremely poor” PSEQ scores, indicating a high level of disability. One year after migraine surgery, however, the patients showed an extremely large improvement of 112 percent in average PSEQ scores, much higher than previous studies of patients with other types of chronic pain. \n“The [study] results show that migraine surgery can lead to dramatic improvements in functioning and coping ability, even in patients who are very disabled before surgery,” said Dr. William G. Austen Jr., of Massachusetts General Hospital, who performed the migraine surgeries in the study patients. \nOn the calendar \nChesterfield Mall hosts its first-ever health and wellness event, the Gateway to Health 2018 Wellness Expo , from 1-7 p.m on Monday, Feb. 12. in the mall’s lower level center court.

        "text": "February 9, 2018 \nMore than 50 conditions can cause or mimic the symptoms of dementia.” but “Alzheimer’s (can only be) distinguished from other dementias at autopsy.” — from a Harvard University Health Publication entitled “What’s Causing Your Memory Loss? It Isn’t Necessarily Alzheimer’s” \n“Medications have now emerged as a major cause of mitochondrial damage, which may explain many adverse effects. All classes of psychotropic drugs have been documented to damage mitochondria, as have statin medications, analgesics such as acetaminophen, and many others. ” – Drs Neustadt and Pieczenik , authors of “Medication-induced Mitochondrial Damage and Disease” \n“We are at the beginning of the biggest medical tragedy that mankind has ever witnessed. Never before in history has the medical establishment knowingly created a life-threatening nutrient deficiency in millions of otherwise healthy people, only to sit back with arrogance and horrific irresponsibility and watch to see what happens. I cannot help to view my once great profession with a mixture of sorrow and contempt.” — Peter Langsjoen , MD, Board-certified Cardiologist, discussing the adverse effects of statin drugs that commonly cause serious, difficult-to-detect statin-induced CoQ10 deficiencies in the mitochondria of heart muscle, the central nervous system, and other body tissues. Dr Langsjoen has said that he sees several cases of statin-induced congestive heart failure in his clinical practice each week. \n“It is also noted that instances of pure forms of Alzheimer’s disease, in the absence of other coexistent brain disease processes, such as infarctions or Parkinson’s disease–related lesions, are relatively uncommon.” – – Daniel Perl , MD, Mt Sinai School of Medicine (2010) \n“Establishing mitochondrial toxicity is not an FDA requirement for drug approval, so there is no real way of knowing which agents are truly toxic.” — Dr. Katherine Sims , Mass General Hospital – http://www.mitoaction.org \n“Big Pharma is engaged in the deliberate seduction of the medical profession, country by country, worldwide. It is spending a fortune on influencing, hiring and purchasing academic judgment to a point where, in a few years’ time, if Big Pharma continues unchecked on its present happy path, unbought medical opinion will be hard to find.” – John LeClarre , author of The Constant Gardener, that focused on the corrupt nature of the pharmaceutical industry. \n“Throughout the 20th century, the pharmaceutical industry has been constructed by investors, the goal being to replace effective but non-patentable natural remedies with mostly ineffective but patentable and highly profitable pharmaceutical drugs. The very nature of the pharmaceutical industry is to make money from ongoing diseases. Like other industries, the pharmaceutical industry tries to expand their market — that is to maintain ongoing diseases and to find new diseases for their drugs. Prevention and cure of diseases damages the pharmaceutical business and the eradication of common diseases threatens its very existence.’ — Dr. Matthias Rath – Journal of the American Medical Association, April 15, 1998 \n“Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry fights the eradication of any disease at all costs. The pharmaceutical industry itself is the main obstacle, why today’s most widespread diseases are further expanding including heart attacks, strokes, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, and many others. Pharmaceutical drugs are not intended to cure diseases. According to health insurers, over 24,000 pharmaceutical drugs are currently marketed and prescribed without any proven therapeutic value. According to medical doctors’ associations, the known dangerous side-effects of pharmaceutical drugs have become the fourth leading cause of death after heart attacks, cancer, and strokes.” — Dr Rath (1998) \n“The medical industry research is highly fraudulent–yes, a lie. The CDC knows full well that vaccines cause autism but are in bed with the pharma industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to force people to buy private industry insurance which forces people to use their discretionary income paying for the unaffordable premiums so they will not have the money to pay for holistic forms of healing.” — Blogger at GreenMed Info \n“Medical journals have devolved into information-laundering operations for the pharmaceutical industry. ” — Richard Horton , editor of The Lancet (March 2004) \n‘At least 50% of the articles published in this ever so prestigious journal were not just bad, but downright fraudulent.” — Marcia Angel , MD, who co-edited the New England Journal of Medicine for about 20 years before she was forced out because she questioned the adverse influence of Big Pharma on the NEJM’s editorial policies. \n“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!” – Upton Sinclair , anti-fascist, anti-imperialist American author who wrote in the early 20th century \n“No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable…for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death.” – President Ronald Reagan , as he signed The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986, absolving drug companies from all medico-legal liability when children die or are disabled from vaccine injuries. \n*** \nOver the past several decades there have been a number of well-financed campaigns, sometimes promoted by well-meaning laypersons, to raise public awareness to the plight of patients with physiological, age-related, short-term memory loss – which is not dementia. Suspiciously, most of these campaigns come from “patient advocacy organizations (PAOs) such as the Alzheimer’s Association that has been misleading the public into believing that every memory-loss patient or dementia patient has Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). \nNot so curiously, it turns out that many – perhaps all – of these campaigns have been funded – usually secretly – by the very pharmaceutical companies that can be predicted to benefit financially by promoting the sale of so-called Alzheimer’s drugs (or even vaccinations!). Such corporate-generated public relations “educational campaigns” are increasingly standard procedure for Big Pharma’s drugs, even prior to FDA approval. In other words, many PAOs are primarily front groups for Big Pharma, although many volunteers is such groups are well-meaning and unaware participants. A lot of good can get done in pro-Big Pharma PAOs, if workers watch out for signs of ulterior pro-drug motives. \nBig Pharma has found that the promotion, de-stigmatization and demand for drug therapies for so-called “mental illnesses” are great tools for marketing their drugs. which are touted as being “of unknown etiology” or “inherited” and therefore unpreventable, incurable but “manageable” with the life-long ingestion of cocktails of two or more drugs that have never even been tested in the rat lab, much less in clinical situations. (See this ) \nA year ago, Alzheimer’s support groups – particularly the Big Pharma-subsidized Alzheimer’s Association -aggressively sponsored a documentary that featured the dementia of country singer Glen Campbell. Campbell had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease despite the well-documented fact that Campbell was infamous for his chronic heavy use of brain-damaging, dementia-inducing, addictive, and very neurotoxic drugs like cocaine and alcohol. Therefore, in reality his dementia was most likely caused by his neurotoxic drug abuse which likely was worsened by the fact that he had also used a lot of brain-altering psychotropic prescription drugs simultaneously. Popular performers like Campbell, who are frequently on mentally- and physically-exhausting concert tours, are well-known to over-use chemical cocktails of illicit and legal drugs, which, when used simultaneously, have far worse than additive adverse effects on the body and brain. \nThe experience of the equally early dementia victim and legendary long-term user of illicit brain-altering drugs, Robin Williams, was similar to Campbell in that both used excessive amounts of psychotropic substances that had adverse effects on their brains, livers and psyches. Williams had recently been diagnosed as having Parkinson’s Disease and Lewy Body dementia (both of unknown etiology!). His desperate act of suicide came in the context of newly-prescribed psychiatric drugs that had been prescribed at Minnesota’s Hazelden facility. The prescription drugs were well-known to cause suicidal thinking. \nOver the past several decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the over-prescribing of brain-altering drugs to both adults and children. During the same era there has also been a dramatic increase in the over-vaccinating of mainly infants and children, but also of adults. \nAnd, not coincidentally, during the same era, there have been tens of millions of new dementia victims (“of unknown etiology”) and tens of millions of previously un-heard-of autoimmune disorders, autism spectrum disorders and other chronic illnesses among the over-prescribed and over-vaccinated populations of innocent children. Chronically ingesting brain-altering pills and simultaneously and regularly being injected with neurotoxic vaccines has dire consequences. Big Pharma’s claims of innocence in the face of these epidemics are bald-faced lies. And Big Medicine has been an accomplice in the whole sordid mess. Apologies are in order. \nIatrogenocide? \nThe blatant promotion of largely preventable, iatrogenic disorders does make a lot of money for Big Pharma and Big Medicine, especially if the once-un-conflicted Big Media (the supposed equalizing Fourth Estate) contributes to the mess by consciously preventing open dialogues with the whistle-blowing side of what should be an honest, open, democratic debate. \nTragically, the corporate-dominated media elites appear to have no interest in disturbing the tranquility of the status quo by actually inviting whistle-blowers on to their talk shows. What is going on? I suspect that there is probably too much glad-handing, elbow-rubbing and cross-investing (plus the acceptance of Big advertising that intimidates and silences) going on among the many corporate entities that have too much investment in keeping the status quo going strong. \nHow it Began: Thc Story of Alois Alzheimer \nIn 1910 a German psychiatrist, Alois Alzheimer , published a case history of a single demented and “mentally ill” female patient who had peculiar microscopic findings in her brain at autopsy. In the article he included drawings of what he had seen. The two findings of 1) neurofibrillary tangles and 2) “senile plaques” became the cardinal signs of the disorder that soon was named after him. The peculiar findings are microscopic and therefore only visible at autopsy. Thus the true diagnosis is not a diagnosis that can be accurately made while the patient is still alive. See the information from Harvard below about the differential diagnosis of AD. Alzheimer’s first and only demented patient that he autopsied also showed a loss of 1/3 of the neurons in her cerebral cortex. \nIs the So-called Alzheimer’s Epidemic (of “Unknown Cause”) Actually an Iatrogenic, Drug-and Vaccine-Induced Epidemic That the Medical Profession and Big Pharma are Desperately Trying to Cover Up? \nThe likely answer to that question is yes, and you could say the same thing about the twin epidemics of autistic spectrum disorders and chronic autoimmune disorders among fully vaccinated children in the First World. \nSynchronous with the fast-paced over-vaccination agendas over the past several decades that the Big Pharma-, Big Medicine- and Big Business-dominated “first world”, careful, un-blinded, non-conflicted observers are witnessing and documenting the following inconvenient realities: \n1) There are huge increases in childhood and adult vaccinations that have intramuscularly-injected neurotoxic, blood-brain barrier-destroying ingredients such as aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, glutamate and live viruses; \n2) There is the widespread and chronic use of cocktails of psychotropic drugs that are known to cause brain damage, destruction of the blood-brain barrier, mitochondrial toxicity and dementia; \n3) There is the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs (which also lower the essential, energy-supplying, vitamin-like substance CoQ10) which are known to also cause memory loss, depression and mitochondrial toxicity; \n4) There is the ingestion of the neurotoxic substances fluoride and lead that are contaminating many municipal drinking water supplies; \n5) There is the wide-spread ingestion of a large variety of toxic and poorly-nourishing food additives that Big Food has put in our Standard American Diet (SAD), such as dyes, NutraSweet, Splenda, trans-fat-containing oils and margarines, MSG, etc, plus toxic contaminants such as Round-Up, genetically-modified substances, livestock antibiotics and other poisonous chemicals that are in virtually all non-organic food; and \n6) ETC, ETC, ETC. \nNot coincidentally, there has also been a large parallel increase in the following clusters of disorders: the alarming and increasing incidence of chronic diseases, autoimmune disorders of childhood and autistic spectrum disorders (see this ); b) the alarming increase in the diagnoses of mental illnesses and dementias of supposedly “unknown origin”. \nBoth of those categories are conveniently – and falsely – being blamed on “genetics” by the various guilty parties that are actually at least partially responsible. And, it must be noted: there is no credible evidence for claiming any of the above have genetic causes. \nDisease entities that have no confirmatory lab tests include such disorders as ASD, Asperger’s, Learning Disorders, ADHD, OCD, Bipolar Disorder, Gulf War Syndrome, “mental illnesses of unknown etiology”, etc, etc. These diagnoses, supposedly of “unknown etiology” are multifactorial realities which, via clever marketing efforts and the studied ignorance of what is actually known about their actual root causes, are being blindly treated with brain-altering chemicals that have no chance of curing anything – including the so-called Alzheimer’s Disease. \nIt is important to ask and then demand an honest answer to this important question: “Could there be any connection between our nation’s increasingly common over-prescribing of immunotoxic, neurotoxic, mitochondrial-toxic, blood-brain barrier-toxic, synthetic prescription drugs and the CDC and AAP-blessed over-vaccination agendas that are so commonly mandated for disorders that supposedly “have no known cause”? Any grade schooler would respond to that question by rolling their eyes and saying “well of course!” \nCould the economically disabling (indeed bankrupting) American epidemic of supposedly “disorders of unknown origin” be found to have recognizable root causes and therefore be curable and, most importantly, preventable, rather than chronically “managed” with unaffordable, disease-inducing prescription drugs that will have to be monitored, changed, renewed or have their dosages adjusted at monthly office visits for the rest of their drug-sickened lives. \nThe above are extremely important questions, especially in the case of America’s chronic disease epidemics. There are many so-called patient advocacy organizations (PAO) that are heavily funded by major for-profit, corporations that are not donating money out of the goodness of their cold hearts. Such Big Pharma-supported PAOs go to great lengths to hide the financial support they get from their foundations, sugar daddies and assorted investors. \nThere are hundreds of PAOs that have ulterior motives, and there are many altruistic ones that are barely surviving on shoe string budgets that depend on small donations. The latter PAOs are trying to do the right thing and do not take money from big corporations that are in the game for the money. PAOs like the Alzheimer’s Association, NAMI, MakeItOK, and the American Parkinson Disease Association take a lot of money from Big Businesses and some pretty nefarious Big Money foundations. The leadership of that kind of PAO acts like they are totally unaware of (or willfully ignorant about) the fact that many prescription drugs, especially psychotropic drugs, ARE known to be both dependency-inducing AND a potential cause of irreversible brain damage. \nLong-term use of such neurotoxic, psychoactive drugs would be easily expected to worsen any number of neurological (and therefore psychological) disorders because of the brain cell death that easily happens when enough brain cell mitochondria have been wounded or killed off. (Note: See the info on drugs and mitochondria farther below.) \nOne of the big problems in America’s corporate-controlled culture, media and medical industries is that the giant pharmaceutical corporations, who are in the business of developing, marketing and profiting from their known-to-be toxic drugs and vaccines have a special interest in pretending that there is no known preventable or curable causes for the disorders for which they have products to sell you. \nWe have all heard the following common and very dis-informational ruse – which is both unproven and simplistic: We are told – by those who want to sell us a drug or vaccine, that “the problem that you have is probably genetic”, implying that the disorder is neither-preventable nor curable. The implication is that the current epidemic of iatrogenic disorders such as the opioid epidemic (“iatrogenic”=”doctor-caused, treatment-caused or prescription drug-caused”) is not the responsibility of Big Pharma’s or Big Medicine’s toxic products or vaccines! And we lemmings, both the drug swallowers and the drug prescribers, to our great shame, all-too-often don’t question the obvious lie. \nIt should be a concern for everyone who knows or treats demented or Parkinsonian patients, that the most powerful and wealthy and well-staffed PAOs are known to be front groups for the giant pharmaceutical companies that profit handsomely from any number of virtually useless (and definitely not curative) drugs for dementia such as Pfizer’s Aricept, Novartis’s Exelon, Eli Lilly’s Namenda, and Janssen’s Razadyne. \nInterestingly, Pfizer announced last month that they were abandoning their increasingly attempts to search for and test new drugs for Alzheimer’s Disease and Parkinson’s Disease. They closed the research branches for both classes of disease. Pfizer saw that they were throwing good money after bad, having already wasted billions of dollars on what they now recognize as a futile search for new drugs. Such searches are still being pursued by many other pharma companies – for now. Pfizer’s stock dropped $4 a share on the announcement. \nBut both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s are neurodegenerative disorders whose hallmarks involve permanent brain damage of certain brain areas. Knowing that both diseases are caused by permanent and irreversible brain damage, how any investor could have thought that a chemical or vaccine could have been effective as treatment or cure is beyond me. \nHowever, knowing how cunning these Big Pharma corporations are, I suspect that Pfizer, in the case of their Aricept drug , still made a ton of money selling it. It should come as no surprise to anyone that we prescribing physicians are as bamboozled by the prevalent corporate pseudoscience and Big Pharma’s fraudulent advertising as are our patients, whether the commercials come at us from television, magazines, journals or attractive female drug detail reps who come bearing pens, pizzas and post-it notes. \nThe BBC reported a few days ago that there were over 100 clinical trials currently being done on Alzheimer’s drugs around the world, but that “more than 99% of trials for Alzheimer’s drugs have failed in the past 15 years.” So, if you are waiting for a cure, don’t hold your breath. Pfizer likely made a smart move. Expect other drug companies to follow suit soon. \nPrescription Drug-Induced – and Vaccine-Induced – Mitochondrial Disorders \nAs opposed to the rare “primary” or congenital mitochondrial disorders like muscular dystrophy, “acquired” mitochondrial disorders are often caused by commonly prescribed drugs and/or vaccine. They are also generally poorly understood and therefore difficult to diagnose by busy health practitioners. Also – naturally – iatrogenic disorders are rarely made by the physician whose treatment caused the disorder. \nWhen I went to med school, even my professors knew anything about the lethal effects that drugs and vaccines could do to mitochondria, – or even normal brain cells, for that matter. There weren’t that many toxic drugs or vaccines (albeit many of them contained mercury) that could be prescribed back in the good old days. I recall that the function, physiology-and microanatomy of mitochondria were poorly understood back in those years, although our professors did try to teach us med students something about the incomprehensible and soon-forgotten Kreb’s cycle. \nMitochondrial research, especially in the last few decades, has proven the cause and effect relationship between a variety of commonly prescribed medications and vaccines and mitochondrial disorders. That evidence seems to have been cunningly covered-up by the for-profit pharma groups (who control what gets taught in med schools, published in their medical journals or what gets presented at their continuing education courses. Big Pharma appears to even have control over what gets discussed in the mainstream media, especially what is offered to readers by the basically undiscerning “health and science” journalists who do not know much about basic medicine, neuroscience, neurochemistry or micronutrition. \nVarious other powers-that-be are involved educating most of us because of the serious economic consequences that might happen if any negative information (like what you are reading hers) was allowed in the popular press. The profit-seeking stake-holders in the pharmaceutical and medical industries, most of whom profit mightily from the routine and increasing use of neurotoxic drugs and vaccines would be very displeased if the preceding or following information got out. I submit that Big Pharma’s cover-up of the connections between their drugs and drug-induced disorders is totally unethical and, in the opinion of many whistleblowers, criminal. \nAn Honest Patient Guide for Dementia Patients (from Harvard!) \nSo I was pleasantly surprised to recently find a reasonably honest guide for dementia patients on a Harvard University website. These suggestion, contrary to the vast majority of Big Pharma’s products, are compatible with the Hippocratic Oath. (The entire guide can be accessed here .) \nThe information at the Harvard site stated that there were over 50 conditions that could cause or mimic the symptoms of dementia. In other words, there are over 50 conditions that could be mis-diagnosed as Alzheimer’ dementia. I hadn’t been taught anything about that reality when I went to med school, and I doubt that many of my physician colleagues had either. And besides, what medical practitioner in our over-busy, double-booked clinic environment, even if he or she was aware, has the time to thoroughly rule out the 50 conditions when confronted with a patient with memory loss? It’s simpler to just call every case of dementia Alzheimer’s! And nobody ever questions such an authoritative-sounding diagnosis, even though the only definitive way to confirm the diagnosis is at autopsy. \nI have often said to my patients and folks who attend my seminars: “it takes only 2 minutes to write a prescription, but it takes 20 minutes to not write a prescription”. And in the current for-profit clinic culture, time is money and few physicians are given the “luxury” of spending adequate time with their patients. (In defense of the physicians that I know, they are not happy about that reality but don’t know what to do about it.) \nIt is so tempting to use the popularized, but rather squishy label of Alzheimer’s rather than to educate ourselves about the possibility of drug- or vaccine-induced dementia. But what is so important is that many of the 50+ conditions are preventable or reversible, which will be therapeutic only if the conditions are identified before more brain damage from drug-induced or environmental-poison-induced neurotoxicity occurs. \nThe Harvard guide actually said that \n“medications are common culprits in mental decline. With aging, the liver becomes less efficient at metabolizing drugs, and the kidneys eliminate them from the body more slowly. As a result, drugs tend to accumulate in the body. Elderly people in poor health and those taking several different medications are especially vulnerable.” \nThe guide continued with a list of the possible classes of prescription drugs that number in the hundreds: \n“The list of drugs that can cause dementia-like symptoms is long. It includes antidepressants, antihistamines, anti-Parkinson drugs, anti-anxiety medications, cardiovascular drugs, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, narcotics, sedatives.” \nThe Harvard guide went on to emphasize that Alzheimer’s can only be accurately diagnosed on a post-mortem examination. The guide states that \n“Alzheimer’s is distinguished from other dementias at autopsy by the presence of sticky beta-amyloid plaques outside brain cells (neurons) and fibrillary tangles within neurons (all indicative of cellular death). Although such lesions may be present in any aging brain, in people with Alzheimer’s these lesions tend to be more numerous and accumulate in areas of the brain involved in learning and memory.” \n“The leading theory is that the damage to the brain results from inflammation and other biological changes that cause synaptic loss and malfunction, disrupting communication between brain cells. Eventually the brain cells die, causing tissue loss and cell carcasses or scars. In imaging scans, brain shrinkage is usually first noticeable in the hippocampus, which plays a central role in memory function.” \nBut even the Harvard guide inexplicably failed to mention known mitochondrial toxins such as statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs such as Pfizer’s Lipitor), metformin, Depakote, general anesthetics, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, fluorinated psychotropic drugs (like many of the SSRIs and the so-called antipsychotics). \nBig Food and Big Vaccine Corporations are Guilty of Causing Chemical Brain Trauma \nAnd here is some more information about the mitochondrial toxins that have gone unrecognized in our environment: This information must be understood, because alone, there may not be huge risks, but in combination with other toxins, they will have additive, if not synergistic (multiplier) adverse effects. \nFor example, the artificial sweetener NutraSweet (aspartame) is in hundreds of food products and diet sodas that are sold in non-organic food stores. Every molecule of the artificial chemical, when it reaches 86 degrees F [body temp is 98.6 F], releases one molecule of the excitotoxin aspartic acid, one molecule of the adrenalin precursor phenylalanine and one molecule of the cellular toxin methanol [wood alcohol]. Methanol rapidly metabolizes into the known Class A carcinogen and mitochondrial poison formaldehyde [embalming fluid]). Another toxic metabolite of aspartame is diketopiperazine (DKP) which when “nitrosated” in the gut, produces a compound which is similar to N-Nitrosourea, a powerful brain tumor-causing chemical. \nThe tri-chlorinated sucrose molecule that is sold as another artificial sweetener is called Splenda (sucralose). The synthetic chemical has been marketed as an insecticide in China) and is in many food products. I killed an entire colony of ants in my garden overnight by sprinkling some Splenda on the soil. I then had no idea about how to decontaminate my ant-free garden from the Splenda poisoning. \nThe above are only a small number of the synthetic chemicals that are capable of causing mitochondrial damage in brain cells – damage that can cause memory loss, confusion and cognitive dysfunction, all early symptoms of dementia. \nIn summary, it must be regarded as tragic, but all–too-common, for reversible and preventable drug-induced dementias to be mis-diagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease “of unknown etiology” and then quickly and reflexively mis-treated with costly, essentially worthless drugs, whose mitochondrial toxicities are ignored. \n(The pharmaceutical industry, it should be noted, is not required by the FDA to test its drugs for mitochondrial toxicity, again exhibiting the total disdain for the Precautionary Principle by both industry and the regulatory agencies such as the FDA and the CDC.) \nThere is much more in the basic neuroscience literature that has been written by un-bought scientists who do not have conflicts of interest with Big Pharma and Big Medicine, that offer proof of the connections mentioned above. The authors of these research and clinical articles have raised the questions and have published the proof that concerned families of patients and their physicians desperately need to know. Sadly, these authors are often black-listed from the major medical or scientific journals that take advertising money from Big Pharma or whose peer reviewers have been co-opted by Big Pharma money or influence. \nDon’t expect Big Pharma to respond or to offer apologies or admit to their unethical (or sometimes criminal) behaviors. Do expect denials, delays, dismissals, distractions, or the attempts to discredit the un-biased scientific evidence that exposes subterfuge in the name of maintaining large profits for Big Pharma’s or Big Medicine’s stakeholders. \nHere are the abstracts from just two of the many peer-reviewed journal articles that have been published in any number of science journals that support the thesis of this column. \n* \nGary G.

Rich Harbert rharbert@wickedlocal.com @richharbertOCM \nPLYMOUTH – Flu season may be impacting platelet and blood donations regionally, but supplies haven’t showed any signs of drying up at the local hospital. \nJoanne Thibodeau, a clinical specialist working in the blood bank at BID-Plymouth hospital, said the hospital continues to receive shipments of blood and platelets from the American Red Cross every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. And if there is a run on supplies, the hospital can request additional units for other daily supply deliveries during the week. \nThe hospital used 255 units of blood in December. That is the second highest amount of transfused units in a month in 2017. The hospital transfused 256 units last March. \nThibodeau said there are times of the year when New England tends to be in a position to help other areas of the country that find themselves in need of blood because of hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. \nShe noted that winter storms and flu season can create shortages that leave New England hospitals vulnerable to shortages. \n“At Plymouth, we always seem to get the products even when there is a shortage. Usually the American Red Cross will call other areas and if they can’t supply we will call the Rhode Island Blood Center or the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and they would supply us with the product we need,” Thibodeau said. \nMost of the blood and platelets used at the local hospital are used in the oncology department and for in-patient therapy. \n“We haven’t had a really critical episode for a long time. A few years back we couldn’t get any. For some reason, we had no blood, but so far we don’t have that issue any more,” Thibodeau said. \nPlatelets can sometimes be harder to get because they have a shorter shelf life. Red blood cells, used for trauma, surgery, premature births and sickle cell and other blood disorders, have 42-day shelf life. \nPlatelets, used for cancer treatments and surgery, have a five-day shelf life. Plasma, used for burn patients, shock and bleeding disorders, can last up to a year if frozen. \nWhile demand for blood was high in December, demand for platelets was relatively low. \nThe hospital used 37 units of platelets last March and only 10 in December.",

        "text": "Fennimore teen receives pancreatic transplant / By Erin Martin Editor - Fennimore Times 608-822-3912 POSTED February 8, 2018 1:06 p.m. Tweet It was a Friday. Fennimore Schools would be letting out for the winter holidays in two weeks. But Breelyn Neuroth wasn’t at school, doing homework, watching the calendar, as she got ready for the holidays. The Fennimore High School Freshman sat in a Madison hospital room waiting for a doctor to come in and tell her if today was the day she would receive a new pancreas. Breelyn sat all day. This was the third time she had been informed of a possible pancreas donation, though the first to bring her to the hospital. As the day wore on, the chance that this was the day the doctors would give a go-ahead for a transplant seemed uncertain. That changed when nurses wheeled in a pre-op bed and informed her they had come to take her to surgery. It was time. After living with diabetes since age three, the Fennimore teen’s life was about to change dramatically. When Breelyn returned to school at the beginning of January, she wasn’t allowed to carry her book bag – the incision running the length of her abdomen, sternum to pelvis, was still healing. But the constant need to prick her fingers to check her blood sugar levels was gone, as were the frequent shots of insulin she had been giving herself. There were no more calculations of trading a moment of celebration – eating a cupcake at a birthday – for needing insulin. “I can do a lot more,” Breelyn says. “I can stay overnight with a friend, I can eat what I want.” That might not sound like much if you have always been able to do these things, but it’s huge if you haven’t. Breelyn became diabetic at age three after an autoimmune reaction shut down her pancreas. Without a functioning pancreas, her body couldn’t produce insulin, necessary for maintaining consistent blood sugar levels. She needed to have her blood sugar monitored and insulin injected. ...

        "text": " Kristi and Justin Rogers decided to go public with their most personal and private moment of anguish — all for a greater cause.\nThe Arlington, Kentucky, couple is sharing the heartbreaking photographs of the exact moment their 2-year-old daughter, Adalynn Grace, died from complications of a congenital heart defect on Jan. 26. But they are doing so with the conviction that by sharing their loss, they can spread the word about their daughter's condition and the importance of organ donation .\nSuha Dabit/World of broken hearts Kristi and Justin Rogers say their final goodbyes to their 2-year-old daughter Adalynn, who died from complications of her congenital heart condition on Jan. 26. Then maybe another family out there could be spared from the pain they are experiencing, the couple told TODAY.\n\"When we asked for the photographs to be taken, it wasn't with the thought of sharing them, it was for us to remember our daughter's last moments,\" Kristi Rogers, 27, said. \"But after I saw them I thought it could help more people than I could ever have imagined. Let her share her story.\"\nSuha Dabit/World of broken hearts The Rogers family is hoping these photos will spread the word about their daughter's illness and about the need for organ donation. Rogers learned about her daughter's heart condition when she was 32 weeks pregnant : Only one chamber of the baby's heart developed enough to pump blood. Adalynn was a fighter from the beginning: Two days after she was born on Jan. 11, 2016, she had her first heart surgery . A second surgery followed five months later and the tenacious tot adjusted to living with a feeding tube and intense examinations every four to six months.\n\"She got her meds and her food through her tummy, other than that she was a normal kid,\" her mom said. \"We made it as normal as possible.\"\nSuha Dabit/World of Broken Hearts Kristi Rogers's anguish was captured at the family's request by photographer Suha Dabit. But in November, Adalynn's condition took a turn for the worse as she went into heart failure. Doctors warned the family that their daughter needed a heart transplant to survive. Unfortunately, they ran out of time to find a suitable donor: Adalynn suffered severe brain damage from a lack of oxygen on Jan. 23.\nOnce they made the decision to take their child off life support three days later, photographer Suha Dabit was enlisted at the suggestion of a social worker. The goal was to document their final moments, as Kristi, Justin and the couple's three sons — Camden, 7, Greyson, 5, and Kolton, born this year on his sister's second birthday — said their goodbyes.\nSuha Dabit/World of broken hearts Brothers Camden, 7, Greyson, 5, and Kolton, one month, mourn the loss of their sister. \"I witnessed the agony in a mother's eyes of not wanting to let go of her precious daughter, but loved her so very much she couldn't bear seeing her suffer any longer either,\" Dabit told TODAY by email.\n\"The photographer had the pictures to us before we turned Addie’s machine off,\" Rogers said. \"Driving home from the hospital, I needed to update all the people who prayed for her and followed her story, and I couldn’t think of a better way than to share those pictures.\"\nThen the family got the idea of sharing them wider. While Adalynn's organs were unsuitable for donation because of her condition, her parents hope the publicity from their case will inspire others.\n\"Really the message is to donate if you can, as hard as it is as when it's your child dying, and I know how hard that is,\" Rogers said. \"If someone would have donated to Addie she would still be here.\"\nBut the photos, above all else, are a personal testament to a family's love for each other, and a reminder to Camden, Greyson, and Kolton as they get older of the bond they had with their late sister.\n\"It breaks my heart again every time I look at the pictures,\" their mother said.",

        "text": "Photos by Slaven Gujic GCU News Bureau \nOh, what a chatty, gabby bunch those George Bernard Shaw characters are in “Major Barbara,” the playwright’s treatise about what salvation really is made of – money and power. \nThe cast of Ethington Theatre’s production of the awfully clever satire, which pits humanitarian, idealist daughter against her straight-up realist munitions manufacturer father, is similarly awfully good at spilling word after word – streams of glorious word after word – of Shaw’s brilliant dialogue. Salvation Army officer Barbara Undershaft (Christine Ward) and her munitions-making, millionaire father, Andrew Undershaft (Cameron Cluff), don’t quite see eye to eye in Ethington Theatre’s production of “Major Barbara,” opening Friday. \nTake these effervescent beauties: \n— “Choose money and gunpowder; for without enough of both you can’t afford the others.” \n— “My religion? Well, my dear, I am a millionaire. That is my religion.” \n— “There’s bad blood on your hands and nothing but good blood can cleanse them.” \nIn short, the cast never faltered, not once, in delivering all the dialogue Shaw mercilessly pummels at them at Wednesday’s dress rehearsal, which precedes its 7:30 p.m. opening Friday at Ethington for a two-weekend run. But oh did they deliver the monologues, the peppering of character speeches, the quips and all without one misstep. \nNow that takes some doing. \nDirector Michael Kary said the cast’s big challenge was to memorize and deliver so much dialogue, and they exceeded that challenge. \nAdd to that a hands-down, atomic bomb shelter-chic, industrial set that included torpedoes hanging from the ceiling as lighting fixtures, wheeled torpedo benches, New York warehouse loft-type sliding doors and a line of red bulbous lights a la underground nuclear facility. Kudos to scenic designer William Symington and also to lighting designer Claude Pensis , who transforms the stage from the warm glow of the Undershaft home to the bright white light of the family’s weapons facility. \nAnd top it off with some spot-on performances by actors unabashed in tackling so many dialects. Lady Britomart (Emily Sheppard) has been estranged from her millionaire husband Andrew Undershaft for some time. \nFor those unfamiliar with “Major Barbara,” the play follows the arrival of millionaire weapons maker Andrew Undershaft ( Cameron Cluff ) to the home of his estranged family, including wife Lady Britomart ( Emily Sheppard ), sniveling son Stephen ( Ryan Ardelt ), daughter Barbara ( Christine Ward ) and fiance Adolphus Cusins ( Brandon Brown ), and daughter Sarah ( Halee Conway ) and her fiancé, Charles ( Isaac Bills ). \nUndershaft makes a deal with Barbara. He will go with her to the Salvation Army, where she’s an officer; in exchange, she will visit his munitions factory. \nBarbara wants to do good deeds and save souls and thinks she can do it at the Salvation Army. \nBut when her father arrives, he conveys his thoughts on the matter: that you can do more good and can help make a dent in poverty, not through good deeds, prayers and faith, but through wealth and power. He says it is wealth that builds churches and keeps organizations such as the Salvation Army going. \nBarbara is in a pickle when her father offers to donate a large amount of money to the Salvation Army. She refuses to take the donation, knowing that his wealth is tied to war. But will she come to accept her father’s worldview: that money, dirty or not, will do the most good? \nShaw also presents a unique twist in this play. Undershaft is a foundling who was adopted by his father, also named Andrew Undershaft. It has become a tradition in the family for all of the patriarchs to be foundlings and to adopt the same name. Professor of Greek Adolphus Cusins (Brandon Brown) joined the Salvation Army to be closer to Barbara. \nCluff, as arms maker millionaire Andrew Undershaft, sashays onto the stage, his confidence and eloquence at nth-degree levels. You feel his character’s superiority in the way he walks and kind of curls and moves about the stage. But it’s toward the end of the play, when his character puts away his aristocratic niceties and unleashes this verbal storm, railing about how he grew up in poverty, that Cluff really shines. He digs deep with this rumble and insistence in his voice. \nWard, who plays his favorite daughter, title character Barbara Undershaft, exhibits a self-assured grace and take-command attitude that befits her character, though Ward leaves room for her character to exhibit even more power. Still, her grace makes for a strong contrast against Andrew Undershaft. \nWhen it comes to ultimate uppitiness, you can’t fail with Sheppard’s Lady Britomart and the Undershafts’ only son, Stephen. \nSheppard as Lady Britomart torpedoes her dialogue at the audience, talking so fast it’s hard to keep up, and she imbues her character with that proper, put-upon demeanor, while the audience feels Stephen’s whiny, better-than-thou priggishness, thanks to Ardelt, in something as simple as how he holds his teacup and his lippy expressions. \nCaleb Raney , as the violent, hard-to-redeem Bill Walker, just sneers his way through the production, holding his body in this crooked kind of way that brings Walker to life on the stage. Brandon Brown fits as Greek professor Adolphus Cusins, easily conveying the character’s learned, nose-in-the-books intellectual, idealistic side. \nBeyond the sharp, funny performances and witty lines, Ethington’s production of “Major Barbara” steps it up with the costuming, under the helm of costume designer Nola Yergen . While the play is set in the early 1900s, the characters wear dress that’s updated enough to seem contemporary, such as 1940s-ish type suits and skirt suits. Bill Walker (Caleb Raney, left) shuns salvation and takes out his anger on Jenny Hill (Camryn McCullers) in “Major Barbara.” \nThen there’s a scene of characters dancing with missiles in their hands that really captured the humor of this production. \nThe only wobble at Wednesday night’s rehearsal was that some characters’ Cockney accents would slip now and again, and then there were the usual near opening night hiccups, such as safety hats falling off characters and a “fire” prop that didn’t fire down when it was supposed to. \nOtherwise, be brilliant yourself and see one of the shows at 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 2 p.m. Sunday, 7:30 p.m. Feb. 16-17 and 2 p.m. Feb. 18. \nAlso starring in “Major Barbara” are Osama Awadalla as Snobby Price, Megan Sutton as Rummy Mitchens, Trustin Adams as Peter Shirley, Camryn McCullers as Jenny Hill, Mandy Tompkins as Mrs. Baines, Christina McSheffrey as Bilton, and John Wilson as Morrison. \nIF YOU GO \nWhat : “Major Barbara” by George Bernard Shaw \nWhere : Ethington Theatre, GCU campus \nWhen : 7:30 p.m. Feb. 9-10, 2 p.m. Feb. 11, 7:30 p.m. Feb. 16-17 and 2 p.m. Feb. 18 \nTickets : GCU students get one free ticket with their student ID.

        "text": "Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for people to overcome “a fatal reluctance” to talk about organ donation, as a minister from the Department of Health visited a London synagogue to discuss opt-out organ donation. Jackie-Doyle Price was hosted by North Western Reform Synagogue (Alyth) on Thursday evening, accompanied by Sally Johnson, the director of organ donation and transplantation at NHS Blood and Transplant. They met Rabbi Josh Levy and heard from peoples different experiences of organ donation, as part of the government’s ongoing consultation into a system of opt-out organ donation, as opposed to the current opt-in system. The consultation ends on 6 March.\nSome Orthodox Jewish leaders have expressed concern about an opt-out system, but the majority of the community appears to be in favour, as government figures suggest shifting the balance of presumption could save the lives of 6,500 people currently waiting for a transplant.\nREAD MORE: OPINION – Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner: Changing to opt-out organ donor system will save lives Currently, 80 percent of people say they would be willing to donate their organs but only 36 percent register to become an organ donor.\nJackie-Doyle Price speaking at Alyth\n“Every day, three people die for want of a transplant, which is why our historic plans to transform the way organ donation works are so important,” said Hunt. “We want as many people as possible to have their say as we shape the new opt-out process.”\nHe added: “As well as changing the law, we also need to change the conversation. It can be a difficult subject to broach, but overcoming this fatal reluctance to talk openly about our wishes is key to saving many more lives in the future.”",

        "text": "War is Boring ^ | February 6, 2018 | Tom Cooper \nPosted on 02/09/2018 7:16:11 AM PST by sukhoi-30mki \nSome 50 air forces and air arms around the world operate different variants of the famous Mil Mi-24 Hind attack helicopter. Market for upgrades of this type is therefore huge  and the competition is correspondingly fierce. \nThe best-known upgrades for Mi-24s are offered by different Russian and Czech companies, but also by the Israeli Aircraft Industries, WZL in Poland and SAGEM in France. \nHowever, one of the least-well-known yet biggest and most successful upgrades of Mi-24s ever was launched by the South African company called Advanced Technologies and Engineering. The Super Hind upgrade in question resulted in spectacular modifications to the original airframe. \nHowever, for reasons related to the small size, and thus the influence, of the company in question  as well as its binding to strict confidentiality agreements with customers and fierce competition from Europe and Russia  the project nearly killed the company. \nOriginally, ATE was a group of small private enterprises based in Midrand, South Africa, that used to be involved in management of defense programs, with a focus on integration of avionics and weapons systems on military aircraft. \nIn two decades of existence, ATE became involved in development of several programs, including avionics- and weapons-integration for Spanish Mirage F.1 fighter-bombers and South African PC-7 Mk.II turboprop trainers and the development of systems for the South African Rooivalk attack helicopter. \nHaving successfully completed the work on the Rooivalk, the ATE first took interest in the Mi-24 in 1996. As of the time, dozens of Mi-24s had been acquired by multiple air forces in Africa, Asia and Latin America. \nATE purchased two for itself  these received the registrations ZU-BOI and ZU-GAL  and began the work on determining their flight envelope and operational characteristics. Subsequently, the company began adding modifications, progressively developing upgrade packages designated Super Hind Mk.II, Mk.III, Mk.IV and Mk.V. \nUnlike other companies offering similar upgrades, the ATE didnt retain the original navigational and attack suites while loading the airframe with additional equipment. Instead, it first focused on that types deficiencies in regards of night-combat capabilities, fire-power, reliability and troublesome and expensive logistics. \nFurthermore, during the flight testing in 1999 the South Africans found out that Mi-24 was much overweight, which in turn reduced its agility. Finally, the ATEs engineers concluded that the further work on Super Hind would have to be cost-effective, include little or no development risks and be fast-tracked. \nAt least 30 Super Hinds Mk.IIIs remain in service with two squadrons of the Algerian air forces 1st Combat Helicopter Regiment based at Biskra air base. ATE photos Their ideas attracted attention of the Algerian air force which in 1999 placed an order for the upgrade of 34 of its Mi-24 to the Super Hind Mk.II standard. This was a low-cost version retaining Soviet-built weapons system, but replacing existing aiming systems with latest South African technology. \nIn the course of related negotiations and further testing, the Algerians became attracted by the much more advanced Super Hind Mk.III configuration. This included a removal of most of obsolete, Soviet-made avionics  only the air data system, rate gyros and radar altimeter were retained. This resulted in weight reduction of more than 1,800 kilograms. \nInstead, the South Africans installed a digital computer core, a new Doppler radar, GPS-assisted navigational system, the ARINC Mil-Std 1553 data-bus, the Carl Zeiss Optronics Argos 410-Z airborne observation system turret, a dual-feed, hydraulically driven Vektor F2 chain turret with a 20-millimeter GIAT cannon and South African-made ZT-3 Ingwe anti-tank guided missiles. \nFinally, helping Algerians solve often problematic supply of spare parts, ATE tackled the issue of logistics and relatively complex maintenance. The company made the Super Hind Mk.III user-friendly and maintainable even under most primitive conditions and helped Algerians obtain ability to completely overhaul their Super Hinds at home. \nDelighted by results, the Algerians re-negotiated their order and had all 34 Mi-24s upgraded to Mk.III standard. While some of work was undertaken in South Africa, much of it was completed in Algeria. \nSuper Hinds entered service in 2001. Although one helicopter was written off after an early training accident, the project proved successful beyond the imagination of most of the people involved. Several of Algerian pilots commented that they experienced no problems while re-qualifying, and pointed out the seamless integration of new components with the original helicopter as the reason for success of the project. \nFurthermore, they stressed, the weight savings considerably improved the hot & high performance of the Super Hind. Before soon, the type was blooded in combat against Islamist extremists in southern Algeria, and proved lethal beyond any doubt  especially by night. \nUnsurprisingly, the Super Hind Mk.III attracted lots of public attention abroad. Emboldened, the ATE offered it to a number of East European air forces that were in the process of joining the NATO. At the same time, it intensified further research and development of more advanced variants, and began considering similar upgrades for the Mil Mi-8s and Mi-17s. \nThats when the troubles began. The Russians fell all over ATE. According to some contemporary Russian commentators, the Super Hind Mk.III was dangerous to fly. South African inventions would place Algerian crews at great risk. \nIronically, while explaining that the South African modification of the Mi-24 was little else but taking pieces from Rooivalk and putting them into the Super Hind, the Russians launched an effort to obtain the best available information about ATE-applied modifications. \nFailure of negotiations with Bulgaria and expenses for further research and development of the Super Hind drove the ATE to the verge of bankruptcy. The company then entered cooperation with the Ukrainian AVIAKON but Ukraine placed no orders. Only Azerbaijan opted to upgrade its Mi-24s to the Super Hind Mk. III standard in Ukraine  the source for its original 10 Mi-24s. \nEven then, in an effort to save money, the Azerbaijanis selected a variant deploying Ukrainian weapons, instead of south African. Orders from several other potential customers failed to materialize. A number of these  Nigeria included  opted for much more expensive, yet far less efficient orders in Europe, instead. \nEventually, ATE was acquired by Paramount. This company then entered into cooperation with Yakovlev. As could have been expected, the Russians proved not the least interested in further marketing of this project. \nAlgeria and Azerbaijan thus remain the only users of the Super Hind  probably the most successful, and certainly the most spectacular, upgrade of the venerable Mi-24.

(Source: Nick Lawton, KSLA) (Source: Angela Mills, Pine's sister) (Source: Angela Mills, Pine's sister) BOSSIER CITY, LA (KSLA) - \nFamily and friends of a Bossier City native who was killed in the line of duty are holding a blood drive to remember his life and legacy. \nJonathan Scott Pine, known as Scott Pine, was killed in the line of duty in 2014 while serving as a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Office in Florida. \nThe 34-year-old was responding to a call about car break-ins when he was shot and killed by one of the suspects. \nPine spent much of his life in the ArkLaTex. He went to Airline High School, graduated from Louisiana Tech, and met the woman who became his wife and the mother of their three children in Northwest Louisiana. \nThe Blood Drive will be held at the Bossier Sheriff’s Office on Viking Drive. It will take place Saturday, February 10 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. \n\"That's what he did, he gave blood as often as he could, he would often show pictures of his arm on Facebook saying giving blood and saving lives and that kind of thing, encouraging others to do exactly what he was doing,\" said Angela Mills, Scott's sister. \nThe family is asking anyone who would like to help is welcomed. \n\"Really we just want to help save lives, because through these blood donations people are going to continue to love through him,\" Mills said. \nCopyright 2018 KSLA .

        "text": "Blood bank stores 16,000 units, sufficient for Tet Friday, 02/09/2018, 09:08 The National Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion (NIHBT) currently has about 16,000 units of blood in its blood bank, including over 6,000 units of blood type O, according to Director Bach Quoc Khanh. \nThe total blood volume is sufficient to meet medical treatment needs in Hanoi and northern localities from now to at least three weeks after Tet (Vietnam’s traditional New Year) holiday, he said. The Tet holiday lasts from February 14 to 20. \nThe NIHBT needs a minimum of 1,500 units of blood daily to provide for emergencies and medical treatment at 180 hospitals in Hanoi and northern provinces. Of the amount, 45% need to be Type O, equivalent to about 700 units. \nOn January 5, the institute reported to have only some 6,000 units of blood available, raising concern over a severe blood shortage during Tet. Blood type AB accounted for the smallest proportion of 5.8%, of 352 units, followed by type O which made up 16.8%. Meanwhile, there were over 3,370 units of blood type B, representing 56%. \nIt has called on agencies, organisations and particularly those with blood Type O to take part in blood donation campaigns. The appeal has met with warm response from the public. \nFollowing Tet, the annual Red Spring Festival will be held in a week, starting from March 10, Khanh noted. The blood bank expects to collect 1,000 – 2,000 units of blood each day of the festival. VNA",

Previously we could receive health news only through reports papers and health leaflets, but with the cyber revolution we have so many health news blogs, websites, and discussion planks to give us latest information on different health issues. \nHowever to enlighten the fact that, no matter how much you try to keep up with your wellbeing, age and lifestyle will definitely trap you into some disease or illness, even if it’s a smaller one. And there’s no doubt about one thing that with changing time not only the number, but also the severity of disease also increases. \nKeeping in touch with the latest health news we also come to know about general public health concerns like blood donation camps, kidney or eye donation programs conducted by government health facilities.

The most misused word in the Indian media Ayodhya headline gets Times of India in a jam sans serif \nThere is no scarcity of diseases in modern-day world, but there are some fatal diseases which raise a lot of interest in society, like malignancy, AIDS and diabetes are a couple of the volatile diseases that take thousands of lives every year. These are diseases that however, people not suffering from should be concerned about. \nChildren health news is also very important, as they help us to get all the facts about baby and adolescence health, because with growing age every parent has concerns about their kids or teenager’s health. Change in hormones, proper growth of bones, height and weight percentage, puberty are few things every parent wants to talk about. \nEven mother’s health news is of equal importance because it involves both fetal and maternal health. Providing proper care to the mother and the baby, like the kind of food exercise, or environment that can keep the mother and the baby healthy is equally important. Healthier the person better is his or her lifestyle, so why not keep in touch with the latest development in the health news and make our lives green of health. Share this: ",

By Tom Parkin   \nTom Parkin is a political writer and frequent media commentator with a social democratic perspective. SHARES Join A ‘peoplekind’ of person: do Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s actions match his progressive words? Photo by vlo4 , Creative Commons licensed. \nOnce again, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has made a display of his progressive splendour with his new word “peoplekind,” which quickly became the focus of mockery from Canadian and American conservatives for its politically correct overtones.   Hardwire Your Brain to Cultivate Happiness \n  \nThe comment and its criticism are examples of a vacuous culture war between conservatives and liberals that misses the point and leaves progressives choosing between lesser evils, between bad and worse. \nConservatives took offence (as they do so easily) to “peoplekind,” arguing “mankind” is a perfectly good word that includes all people. Of course it doesn’t. Whatever justifications conservatives provide about the meaning of the ancient English word “mann,” its modern English derivation, “man,” undeniably excludes women. “Peoplekind” may be a goofy word, but most everyone who choses their words carefully — except conservatives — have moved on to more modern words like “humankind” or “humanity.” \nNow for many Canadians, the take-away from the controversy has been that conservatives are hopelessly — perhaps haplessly — sexist. After all, the leader of the federal Conservatives says he will refuse to sing the national anthem because “all they sons’ command” has been banished from it. They seem irredeemable. \nBut beyond the zeitgeist argument between one group that feels politically correct language should be inclusive and another that feels the opposite is a far more important and real-world point. True, the language of equality and inclusion is meaningful. But it is no substitute for changes to our economy, public services and social institutions that create greater actual equality and inclusion. And this is where Trudeau needs to be sharply called to task. Join us and grow independent media in Canada \nA central motif in Trudeau’s politics is his constant use of progressive language that contradicts his government’s actions. Over and over, Trudeau appropriates and mimics the language of progressives while implementing the policies of conservatives. “Peoplekind” is another painful and goofy example of his hollowness. \nOn the very day Trudeau called it a “dumb joke” came disturbing news about how his government is opposing a lawsuit by women employed in the Canadian Armed Forces. Sexual assault, harassment and discrimination have been long-documented in the Forces, an admission made at the highest levels. And in response to that toxic workplace environment, one which must have affected women psychologically, physically and financially, a group of women launched a class-action lawsuit. \nIn fighting the women’s court action, the Trudeau government’s central argument has been that their employer owes them no duty “to provide a safe and harassment-free work environment, or to create policies to prevent sexual harassment or sexual assault.\" \nAnd that’s only one of Trudeau’s hypocritical legal fights against rights of “peoplekind.” Trudeau’s government has refused to comply with multiple orders from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to fully implement Jordan’s Principle, a protocol to end discrimination against First Nations people in providing public services. Adopting Jordan’s Principle ensures First Nations people — like every other Canadian — receive the health care they need without delay, leaving until later the question of whether a federal or provincial program should pay the cost. By last summer, the Trudeau government had already spent over $700,000 in legal fees fighting the Human Rights Tribunal. \nOn Tuesday of this week, the Trudeau government penned a deal permitting the sale of $233 million in military helicopters to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, a despicable human rights abuser. Duterte has confessed to personally killing. He has endorsed the murder of drug users. He told soldiers that martial law allows them to rape with impunity. Now the Canadian government is arming him. \nYet last fall, even as the deal was being developed, Trudeau told Canadians about how he’d taken on Duterte with a “full and frank” discussion stating Canada’s principled opposition to his abuses. Evidently hollow words. \nAnd it’s not the first decision by our self-declared feminist prime minister to arm a violent and sexist political leader. Shortly after the 2015 election, Trudeau authorized a $15 billion military sale to the Saudi king, who represses minorities in his own country and indiscriminately bombs civilians in neighbouring Yemen, killing thousands of innocents. Sure, it was a deal in the works under the bad Harper government. But it was the Trudeau government that signed the export permits and then promised Canada’s role in the arms trade would change. The sale of military equipment to Duterte shows that, too, was an empty promise. \nBut the hypocrisy and hollowness of Justin Trudeau isn’t just about his arms trade policy or his court battles. Running down the list of his major electoral promises in 2015 is a stunning indictment of Justin Trudeau. \nTrudeau gave empty words on the Trans Mountain pipeline, saying the National Energy Board review of the project would be restarted under more stringent NEB rules. Of course the review was never restarted and a little more than a year later, his cabinet approved the pipeline plan. Now, based on unknown criteria, Trudeau declares the pipeline is in the national interest — end of conversation. \nA bit more than a year ago, Trudeau broke his word on electoral reform. And as he danced and dodged to explain himself, something even more upsetting became apparent. Trudeau had told Canadians he was “really open” to options and “it’s not up to any one person” to determine the electoral system. Those were lies. He later confessed that as far back as his 2013 leadership race his mind was closed to the option of proportional representation and that he would never support that option. Yet again, his words were empty. \nHis infrastructure promise clangs with emptiness. He promised $6 billion over four years, then only budgeted $5 billion. Then his government only spent about 40 per cent of 2016/17 funds allocated that year. Worse, rather than use historically low interest rates to fund construction projects as explicitly promised, Trudeau has created an Infrastructure Bank that will pay private investors far higher rates of return — that is, impose far greater costs on Canadians — and will require completed projects to collect fees, fares and tolls to pay the investors. Trudeau’s words promised to pump up the economy and prepare for the future. In actions, he’s creating a lazy, costly rent-seeking scheme run by an investor cartel. \nPromises to fix the broken First Nations education system have been broken. He promised an additional $300 million a year for kindergarten to Grade 12 education, $500 million over three years to fix and build schools, and $50 million a year more to support Indigenous people through post-secondary education. In total, Trudeau promised $2.6 billion over four years for First Nations education. But the actions didn’t follow. When the multi-year spending plan was tabled in the 2016 budget, funds were pushed off until after the next election and the only $1.8 billion was available over four years. \nHe’s broken his words on restoring home mail delivery and eliminating the stock option tax deduction. His tax cut turned out to give the maximum benefit to everyone earning over $90,000 and not a penny to someone earning the actual median income. His government still tables omnibus bills. Blood donation by gay men is still banned. Hasn’t kept his word on youth employment, job and skill training or co-op placements. The list is long. \nAnd a real feminist government would be fixing unaffordable childcare, introducing employment equity and boosting the minimum wage. Trudeau has done none of them. \nYes, words matter. Words and debate are powerful. But empty words disempower. Empty words create an unhealthy frustration, mistrust and skepticism about democratic responsiveness. \nThe conservative nonsense about Trudeau’s “peoplekind” entirely misses the mark — of course it does. But actual progressives can’t take a pass. Trudeau’s hollowness doesn’t just fail to make real change. It distracts and diverts. It disempowers Canadians by leading us to believing no political leader will ever keep promises — that reform of our public services, institutions and economy will never happen, no matter who Canadians vote for. \nIn previous decades our politics has addressed big ideas like universal public health care, pensions and schooling. Today, there is an incredible progressive agenda waiting to be made real by Canadians with optimism and determination. It won’t happen without challenging the dispiriting emptiness of Justin Trudeau. And if, in making that challenge, Canadians’ frustrations cannot be channelled into optimism, Trudeau’s political hollowness may build an ugly rage of resentful self-destruction.",

        "text": "How game theory could ensure you will get blood when you need it February 9, 2018 by Anna Nagurney, The Conversation About 36,000 units of red blood cells are needed in the U.S. each day. Credit: Praisaneg/Shutterstock.com \nBlood shortages in the United States are now at the critical level because of severe weather nationally, coupled with widespread flu . Hundreds of blood drives have been canceled this winter , and the donor base has decreased because of illnesses as well as difficulties encountered in reaching collection sites due to bad weather. The Red Cross is reporting that blood donations are being distributed to hospitals \"faster than they are coming in.\" \nAs in all industries, there are networks, known as supply chains, consisting of suppliers, processors and distributors, that get a product – in this case blood – to the health care providers for the patients in need. But the blood supply chain is not your typical supply chain. \nBlood service organizations, usually nonprofits, compete for donations, since blood (unlike most other products) cannot be manufactured but must be voluntarily donated. The blood then undergoes testing at sites, which can be far removed from the collection locations. Then it is processed and stored, before ultimately being distributed to hospitals and other medical facilities. \nBlood is a perishable, time-sensitive product. Red blood cells (RBCs) have a shelf life of only 42 days, and blood must be kept within the correct temperature range and conditions from the time it is collected from blood donors to the point of transfusion to patients . Moreover, even under ideal circumstances, although 38 percent of the U.S. population is eligible to donate blood at any given time, fewer than 10 percent actually donates blood in a given year. \nMy research team and I at the Isenberg School of Management at UMass Amherst have been studying supply chains for nearly two decades. Our work has yielded insights into commercial supply chains of profit-maximizing firms and supply chain disruptions . Currently, we are investigating the volatile health care landscape, including the growing competition among nonprofits, from hospitals to blood service organizations . \nWhat makes blood supply chains unique \nBlood service organizations compete for blood from donors on the supply side and with one another on the demand side in providing the blood to hospitals and medical facilities. About 36,000 units of RBCs alone are needed every day in the U.S., with the Red Cross supplying about 40 percent of the nation's blood. America's Blood Centers, with 600 blood donor centers, provide about 50 percent of the blood in the U.S. and about one-quarter of the blood in Canada. \nMajor hospitals often have their own blood collection and testing facilities, but they still may have contracts with blood service organizations to maintain an adequate supply and to be able to respond in the case of a major disaster. Blood is transported using different modes of transportation , usually by courier, and using the most efficient route. If the demand is thousands of miles away, then an air courier, including UPS and FedEx , does the transport. \nThe changing dynamics in the blood industry, which have included an increase in the number of mergers and acquisitions and the closure of testing facilities , is forcing blood service organizations to be more innovative in conducting their business. Blood service organizations must price their products competitively based on the supplied quantity in order to recover costs of their operations and to generate revenue for activities such as the research and development required for providing a steady supply of safe blood. \nTaking all these factors into account, coupled with critical shortages due to illnesses and weather, and other seasonality issues, there is a need for a change in blood supply chain management. The new supply chain management model should take into account not only the well-defined problems of perishability, outdating, shortage and wastage , but also the limits on supply capacity, as in the case of the critical shortages this winter and competition among blood banks. My colleagues and I who study game theory believe that game theory can be a powerful tool in assisting decision-makers in assessing and addressing critical blood shortages. \nGame theory analytics \nGame theory is a powerful methodology with major contributions made by John Nash, a Nobel laureate in economics . It allows for the math modeling of interactions among competing or cooperating decision-makers, who are faced with their own objectives and also constraints on resources. Game theory has been used in numerous disciplines but its applications to health care have been only limited and fairly recent; see for example, an application to a hospital competition. We have also shown that game theory can provide more effective disaster relief. \nOur new blood supply chain game theory model captures competition for blood donations on the supply side as well as competition for business on the demand side . The computer-based model includes capacities on supply chain activities such as testing, storage and distribution, which can be adjusted based on various scenarios. It also includes the capacities associated with the number of available donors in different regions. \nIn order to minimize wastage at demand sites, we allowed for lower bounds as well as upper bounds on the volume of RBCs needed at each hospital demand point. Perishability is handled using multipliers to capture how much blood may be lost due to, for example, results from testing, as it moves down different pathways from origin nodes to destination nodes. \nThe algorithmic solution of the game theory supply chain network model yields optimal blood flows plus the prices that should be charged for cost recovery. Since the blood service organizations are nonprofits and interested in doing good, we also included an altruism component in their objectives, while satisfying, as best as possible, the demand. The flexibility of the game theory model allows the decision-makers to evaluate the impacts of a reduction (or increase) in the donor availability and to determine the impacts on blood flows and the prices charged, as well as revenues incurred by the competing blood service organizations. \nIn our study , we found which blood service organization is affected the most in the presence of various supply chain disruptions. That includes a disruption in terms of the donor base due to a disease and disruptions to testing and storage facilities as may happen in a natural disaster. The evaluation of different possible scenarios enables the blood service organizations to be more prepared and resilient. \nFurthermore, as the results in another study of ours have shown , new partnerships over geographical distances – which would correspond to cooperative behavior – can provide significant benefits to blood service organizations, hospitals, as well as patients in the case of a disaster and an accompanying demand surge, as occurred post-Hurricane Maria , which devastated Puerto Rico. \nThe same study provides quantifiable measures for the identification of possible synergies for blood service organizations through alliances. Alliances can result in cost reduction in operations, the reduction of costs associated with possible blood shortages, and even supply surpluses, which result in waste. They can enable the most cost-effective sharing of resources and making the most of the available blood .",

        "text": "7 comments \nA YOUNG mum died after taking her brother's prescription morphine to combat a sore throat, an inquest heard. \nMother-of-two Emily Hicks, 28, had spent the evening of April 27 last year at home in Herbert Avenue, Poole, drinking cans of Stella with her brother Sam. \nThe pair got through the best part of 30 cans in total, the inquest at Bournemouth Coroner's Court heard. \nLate in the evening, Miss Hicks took a large quantity of her brother's prescription morphine and codeine, ostensibly to deal with the pain from a chest infection and sore throat, for which she was already taking antibiotics, codeine and paracetamol. \nA pathologist told the court the lethal cocktail of alcohol and opiate painkillers shut down her breathing and cut off the supply of blood to her brain, causing fatal injuries. \nShe died in Poole Hospital on April 29. \nPathologist Dr Basil Purdue said: \"The results show Emily took a significant amount of opiate morphine shortly before she died. \n\"It was well within the range death is expected even in those with a tolerance, and everything in the circumstances implies Emily had never taken it before. \n\"The combination of morphine with alcohol is known to be particularly dangerous.\" \nCoroner Rachel Griffin recorded a verdict of death by misadventure. \nShe praised Miss Hicks for being an organ donor, noting that four people's lives had been transformed through donations as a result of her death. \n\"If any good can come of her death, it is very important we learn the lesson of how dangerous it is taking someone else's prescription medication, and mixing prescription medication with alcohol,\" she said. \nAlthough Miss Hicks was taking antidepressants at the time of her death, the court heard there was no evidence she had taken her own life, and she had frequently told doctors she would never do so for the sake of her two daughters. \nHer mother Caroline told the court Miss Hicks had been in good spirits on the day of her death, and she was looking forward to starting an apprenticeship as an electrician. \nHer brother Mr Hicks had been prescribed the medication after being struck by a car while crossing a road, sustaining serious injuries. \nHe did not attend the inquest. Detective Sergeant Gary Knight of Dorset Police said Mr Hicks had been interviewed under caution and said his sister had asked if she could use some of his medication, and he had told her to \"help herself\". \nHe was not prosecuted for any offence.",

        "text": "13 Romantic Film & TV Scenes That Prove Food Is the Way to Our Hearts Courtesy of Justina Mintz / HBO Stinky cheese, spilled ketchup, peanut butter, and French fries are among the foods that have helped cook up fictional flings. Abbey White February 09, 2018 \nFrom the iconic to the awkward, food has often played a role in the big and small screens' best romantic moments , from Disney’s Lady and the Tramp to Netflix’s Master of None . But there’s a whole big world of food out there on the big and small screen, not to mention a variety of ways to woo someone with it. From the silly to the sultry, here are 13 moments from television and film that capture all the fun, romantic and surprising ways fictional lovers have won over each other’s hearts with food. Stranger Than Fiction \nClever puns are a hallmark of romance, and there’s probably none better than this one in 2006’s Stranger Than Fiction . The film, which plays on life as pre-written fate, follows I.R.S. auditor Harold (Will Ferrell) after he’s been assigned to bakery owner Ana Pascal’s (Maggie Gyllenhaal) books. He develops feelings for her, but through it struggles with how much control he has over said feelings. That’s because his life is being narrated and seemingly controlled by a disembodied voice (Emma Thompson). While it seems like a weird predicament, having his existence decided by a writer comes in handy when Harold attempts to woo baker Ana with a bouquet of “ flours .” Selfie \nABC’s short-lived (but so good) romantic comedy Selfie explores the power of food to alienate or connect people in an honest and ultimately adorable way. After Henry (John Cho) sees Eliza (Karen Gillan) standing over a trash can and eating alone because “her food digests better” that way, he sets out to turn his officemate’s antisocial behavior around. But after Eliza reveals the real reason she eats this way, the “lesson” ends up being a two-way deal that allows the office primadonna to put her well-guarded walls down while Henry gets someone new to share his meals with. Beauty and the Beast \nAfter trapping Belle’s father in his castle and forcing the young woman to exchange her freedom for his, the Beast had a lot of work to do when it came to earning Belle’s genuine romantic interest. Lucky for him, even some of his more “beastly” qualities could be seen as charming in the right light. How we eat can be a make or break interest for some people, but the Beast’s efforts to meet Belle halfway when it comes to “properly” dining on porridge falls more on the make end of the spectrum. It’s a good reminder that we don’t necessarily have to hide who we are in love. Just, you know, eat less messily. Roswell \nWhile it’s true that the perfect dish can be a life-altering experience, it’s less common to see food become a matter of life and death. Nevertheless, in the very first moments of The WB’s sci-fi teen drama Roswell , that very thing manifests. As two armed men attempt to rob the diner owned by Liz’s (Shiri Appleby) father, shots are fired, and the young teen gets caught on the wrong end of a bullet. Enter Liz’s long-time crush and resident shy boy Max (Jason Behr), who races to her side upon realizing what’s happened. Using some serious doctoring, Max heals Liz’s wound before dumping ketchup on her uniform to cover up any blood from her injury and proof of his powers. The shocking and messy moment ends up jump-starting an out of this world romance. The Princess Diaries \nIn love as in life, we’re prone to make mistakes. How you work to rectify them can be the difference between a broken heart and the romance of a lifetime. Who better to relay that important lesson than The Princess Diaries Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway). Mia has been crushing on her best friend’s brother Michael (Robert Schwartzman) since forever. Unfortunately, he doesn’t notice her until she gets a royal makeover. But by that point, everyone’s seen Mia and caught up in the whirlwind of attention, the princess forgets who her friends are. Lucky for her, Michael’s there to help her remember, and for that, she thanks him with a salty and sweet pizza and M&M apology. Jane the Virgin \nSome say that you’ve found your soul mate when you’ve found someone that can finish your sentences. But what about when they can lay out the best local grub right off the top of your head? In this scene from Jane the Virgin , Jane (Gina Rodriguez) and Rafael (Justin Baldoni) take their son Mateo out for a drive to help him get to sleep. During the run, Jane reveals that she’s got an appetite, but that they can’t stop for more than a few minutes otherwise Mateo will wake up. Cue one good thing that came from Rafael’s (former) party life: expert knowledge of local fast food cuisine. Especially, where to get the best french fries. As you see, Rafael’s food knowledge wins Jane (and us) over. Eat, Pray, Love \nDid you know that when you eat, your brain releases pleasure-inducing chemicals? According to Roger Cone, a professor and chairman of molecular physiology and biophysics at Vanderbilt University, the process—known as ingestion analgesia—is activated by your body, which has reward circuits built in to help you enjoy eating. That probably explains why Elizabeth (Julia Roberts) essentially has a love affair with her entire Margherita pizza in 2010’s Eat, Pray, Love . Well, at least part of the reason. There is a particular unbridled and unmatched joy that comes when you stop caring so much and instead try to embrace the world (and food) around you. Shadowhunters \nFirst dates are always nerve-wracking, but that anxiety can be exceptionally high when it’s your first time dating anyone, well, ever. As is the case for Shadowhunter Alec Lightwood (Matthew Daddario), who ventures to a bar for his first date with Magnus Bane (Harry Shum Jr.), High Warlock of Brooklyn in Freeform’s Shadowhunters . The two’s initial encounter is slightly awkward (the night is full of a lot of firsts for Alec), but after the two have a few drinks, they let loose, proving that a good beer and cocktail go a long way to crafting the perfect date. Fifty Shades Darker \nDepending on who you ask, the Fifty Shades franchise is either highly romantic or just sex(y). This scene featuring Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and Christian (Jamie Dornan) cooking together is a little bit of both. As the newly reunited couple prepares a tasty meal, they spend some time cozying up over the cutting board. But as their conversation turns to working out the kinks in their relationship, Ana discovers that there are both new and old issues between them that may require more than her culinary skills can address. Good thing they’ve got the length of an entire meal to hash it out. Lost \nIf you could bring one thing with you to a desolate island, what would it be? Having never been stranded on one by a plane crash, you probably wouldn’t think to choose your favorite food. But as we see in this clip from ABC’s sci-fi drama Lost , your food cravings may reveal the thing you actually miss most about the mainland. Lucky for Claire (Emilie de Ravin), her budding love interest Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) has a little imagination, a lot of heart, and the perfect solution to her no peanut butter problem. Try not to taste peanut butter (and fall in love) as you watch them. Mostly Martha \nThis storyline for this movie might seem quite similar to the 2007 film No Reservations , which starred Catherine Zeta-Jones. It should, as the American film is the remake of this 2001 German romantic comedy Mostly Martha . The story follows Martha (Martina Gedeck), a chef and a perfectionist consumed by her professional desires. But when Martha becomes guardian of her recently deceased sister’s daughter, Martha experiences a bit of a life shake-up. As she welcomes a new family member, Martha’s restaurant also welcomes a new sous-chef, Mario (Sergio Castellitto), whose unconventionality initially ruffles Martha’s feathers, before spice up her heart and taste buds. In this “sampling” scene, Martha gets to explore her feelings about food and Mario. Insecure Courtesy of Justina Mintz / HBO \nOf the many storytelling skills HBO’s critically-acclaimed comedy Insecure has managed to master, the art of the awkward sexy moment is perhaps one of its best. In this moment from the early part of the show’s second season, Kelli (Natasha Rothwell) invites a guy she’s nicknamed “Sweetie” to join her and her friends Molly and Issa at a food joint following a party. The moment seems to be going well for them until Kelli’s body language reveals something beyond the plate of french fries in front of them is being shared. The move between her and “Sweetie” doesn’t go unnoticed by the other people at the table, but Kelli doesn’t seem to care much. It’s clearly the best plate of fries she’s ever had. The Back-Up Plan \nWe’ve heard of kissing among the stars, but kissing among the cheeses? It’s slightly more romantic than it sounds in the context of 2010’s The Back-Up Plan . Zoe (Jennifer Lopez) is tired of waiting around for Mr. Right to start a family, so she decides to go ahead with sperm donation and start one on her own. Funnily enough, that’s exactly when Mr. Right shows up, in the form of Stan (Alex O’Loughlin), a cheese maker . To help win over her heart, Stan creates a cheese based on Zoe, making her his “cheese muse.” Zoe is somewhat dazzled by it, confirming that romance can happen even while in a stinky cheese barn.

        "text": "9 comments \nBASINGSTOKE’S mosque is opening its doors to people of all faiths and religions for a chance to learn and discover more about Islam. \nThe Albirr Foundation Mosque, in Sarum Hill, is inviting people to come along to visit the place of worship on Sunday, 11 February in a bid to break down barriers around the religion. \nAs part of Visit My Mosque Day, members of the mosque will be on hand to answer any questions visitors may have as well as giving a guided tour of the building. \nVisit My Mosque Day is now in its fourth year and organisers say it has proven to be a successful initiative, showing the work Islamic communities do in the areas they live in a variety of ways ranging from hosting blood donations banks to providing free meals to the homeless. \nImam at the Albirr Foundation Mosque Mohammed Achbib said: “We want people to feel welcome in the mosque and we want them to know that this is a place of worship and that Islam is a peaceful religion. \n“There is a huge misconception about Islam and what a mosque symbolises, so we want to welcome in the local community and break down those barriers and build a line of communication. \n“We don’t want to be secluded from the rest of society and that is what this open day is all about, it is about opening our doors and showing what kind and peaceful people Muslims are.” \nBasingstoke’s MP Maria Miller is due to be in attendance as well as the mayor of Basingstoke and Deane , Councillor Paul Frankum. \nIn November 2017 Mrs Miller spoke to members of the town’s Muslim community and Imam Achbib said she looked forward to working with the Imam and noted the increasing importance that the mosque has on creating a diverse Basingstoke. \nThe Albirr Foundation is a charitable organisation which annually organises Qur’an-based competitions in the United Kingdom, thus encouraging and rewarding the efforts of the young participants and learners of the Qur’an. \nBasingstoke and Deane Borough Council ’s cabinet member for communities and community safety Cllr Simon Bound added: “Basingstoke is a fantastic culturally diverse borough and this is a great opportunity to learn more about this faith and to meet new people. For those who have always been curious to ask questions about the religion then this is your chance.” The open day will run from 11am until 5pm to allow Muslims and non-Muslims to take the opportunity to show solidarity amid fears of rising Islamophobia. \nTo find out more, go to albirr.com.",

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA Cystic Fibrosis sufferer whose life was saved by a lung transplant has urged people in the East Midlands to join the donor register. \nCharlotte Davis has made the appeal after new figures show that residents in the region donated the lowest number of organs in the country. \nCharlotte, 24, said: “Organ donation is an incredible act of kindness. Surgeon and nurse suture patient (Image: Getty) \n“In 2011 my life was saved thanks to my amazing donor and her family, who agreed to fulfil my donor’s wish to donate in the event of death. \n“Struggling to breathe due to Cystic Fibrosis, my lung transplant gave me the chance to graduate from university, jump out of a plane and enjoy every moment life gives. \n“Without organ donation I would have died at 18 years old. “I urge everyone who has the desire to sign up to the register, to do so and please share your wishes with your loved ones.” Read More Social media 'ghost policies' leaving thousands driving without car insurance \nThe figure for the East Midlands represents just 15.8 people per million donating organs during that year - the lowest percentage in England. \nThe report showed that people in the North-West gave the highest number of organs - 162, representing 22.6 donors per million.

Kidneys are important for blood purification in the body (Image: Getty) \nThis saw 753 live-saving and life-transforming transplants being performed by surgeons. \nIt was also revealed that the NHS succeeded in reaching a milestone figure, with 50,000 people alive today thanks to a transplant. Read More Fresh winter weather warning issued in Leicester for the weekend \nHowever, there were 6,388 patients waiting for a life-saving transplant in 2017. \nSadly, 457 patients died while waiting for their transplant on the active list, while 875 were removed from the list altogether. \nThe removals were mostly due to deteriorating health and ineligibility for transplant – with many of these patients passing away shortly after. \nThe North West was found to donate the most kidneys and cardiothoracic organs. \nWhile pancreas donation numbers are highest in the West Midlands, the East of England is highest for liver donations. \nThe statistics were revealed in research carried out for the fitness experts Nuyoo , using the NHS Organ Donation and Transplantation Activity Report for 2016/17.

        "text": "Fertility preservation methods offer hope for cancer patients. (Photo: Pixabay) New Delhi: Many cancer treatments affect the ability to become pregnant, temporarily or permanently.\nFertility preservation (FP) is an effort to retain the fertility of cancer patients, thereby improving their quality of life.\n\"Due to the tremendous rise in risk of cancer, it becomes essential to opt for preserving fertility. After the cancer treatment, a woman's body might recover naturally and produce mature eggs that can be fertilized. However, the medical team may recommend waiting for six months to two years before trying to get pregnant. The length of time depends on the type of cancer and the treatment used,\" said Dr. Priti Gupta Fertility & IVF Expert, First Step IVF Clinic, New Delhi.\nFertility Preservation Options:\n* Egg freezing\nEgg freezing is a well known method of preserving fertility in women. It might be a good choice for women who do not have a partner. For egg freezing, mature eggs are removed and frozen. Once the woman is ready to become pregnant, the eggs can be thawed, fertilized, and implanted in her uterus.\nA new method of freezing called vitrification has made egg freezing more efficient and successful. Another alternative could be to freeze half the eggs and fertilize the rest with sperm from a donor and then freeze embryos.\n* Embryo freezing\nThis is the most established and successful method of preserving a woman's fertility. Mature eggs are removed from a woman's ovaries and fertilized in the lab. This is called in-vitro fertilization (IVF).\nThousands of sperm are put in a sterile dish with each egg. Sometimes one sperm is injected into each egg .The embryos are then frozen to be used after cancer treatment. A woman will have a better chance of a successful pregnancy if several embryos are stored.\n\"For women who are less than 35, a single embryo transfer is the safest way of using IVF to get pregnant so as to avoid multiple pregnancies,\" said Gupta.\n* Ovarian tissue freezing\nThis process involves removal of all or part of one ovary by laparoscopy. The ovarian tissue is usually cut into small strips, frozen, and stored. Ovarian tissue freezing lets women freeze a vastly larger number of immature eggs for future use. When frozen ovarian tissue is re-implanted into the body and regains its functions, immature frozen eggs within the tissue start developing normally.\nPost cancer treatment, the ovarian tissue is placed in the pelvis. Once the transplanted tissue starts to function again, the eggs can be collected and fertilized. The ovarian tissue does take blood supply and she is to produce hormones after its transplanted.\n* For women who are not fertile after cancer treatment\nDonor egg is an option for women who have a healthy uterus but do not have any eggs. Egg donation is often a successful treatment for women who can no longer produce healthy eggs.\nAlso, any woman who has a healthy uterus can maintain a pregnancy by the utilizing the donor embryos.",

        "text": "Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz talk Rob Porter, Russia probe \nReaction on 'The Ingraham Angle' to the resignation of the White House staff secretary and latest developments in the Russia investigation. \nThis is a rush transcript from \"The Ingraham Angle,\" February 8, 2018. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. \nLAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: Good evening, from New Orleans. I'm Laura Ingraham. We have a phenomenal show for you. Just in time for Mardi Gras. Full of great guests, great topics, don't want to miss a minute. Stay right here with us. \nWe have a potential blockbuster revelation from an FBI informant on the Clintons and the sale of American uranium to Russia. \nAnd we've got Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz on the Democrats shameless hypocrisy, howling about Republicans undermining Mueller after doing all they could to sabotage the Whitewater investigation. \nPlus, we are at ground zero in the fight over American heritage and confederate monuments here in New Orleans, and we are going to have a lively debate. \nBut first, Bush and the global elites strike back. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. For eight years during Barack Obama's time in office, his predecessor, George W. Bush, was really quiet. He painted a lot. \nRemember this one he did of the dogs? They look like goats. And W gave speeches and he wrote an autobiography. He did a lot of great charity up appearances for the military, but he refused to utter even the tiniest of criticism as Obama was taking a wrecking ball to America's domestic and foreign policy. \nLet's think about it. When the Obama administration up ended our health care system, Bush said nothing. When Obama ram through bloated stimulus bills and exploded our debt, Bush was mum. When horror stories of neglect at the VA surfaced, total silence. \nWhen the Obama administration abandoned our men in Benghazi and then sent Susan Rice out to lie about the attack, well, the cat had W's tongue, and when Obama threatened religious liberty with his contraception mandate, crickets. When he was asked to comment about Obama policies, this was Bush's customary response. \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nGEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT: I don't think it is good for the country to have a former president undermined a current president. I think it's bad for the presidency, for that matter. \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nINGRAHAM: But since Trump was elected, George W. Bush seems willing and eager to spout off, although, he doesn't mention Trump by name, he might as well, and not only is he criticizing our 45th president, he is now doing so on foreign soil. That's nice. \nToday in Dubai -- where else? He criticized Trump for ending the DACA policy claiming there are people willing to do jobs that Americans won't want to do. Americans don't want to pick cotton in 105 degrees. But there are people that want to put food on their families tables and are willing to do that. We ought to say thank you and welcome them. \nOK, I'm not Will Ferrell, but give me a break. Hillary Clinton couldn't have said it better herself. Bush tried this routine back in 2007. His amnesty with a side of border security, it didn't work then, and it certainly is not going to work in the era of Trump. \nBut Bush didn't stop at needling Trump about immigration. He also offered this trenchant insight on Russia's election interference. \n(AUDIO CLIP) \nINGRAHAM: Is that recorded on an old Barbie tape recorder? What is that? Look, if I were George W. Bush, I wouldn't be so quick to bring up Russian meddling. I kind of recall -- remember that ranch in Crawford? He was pretty cozy with Putin when he came to visit in Texas. \nRemember, he looks into Vlad's eyes, and I think he saw his soul, as I recall. So, it was OK to try to work with Russia back then, but not now, right? Well, I say this about looking into Putin's soul. How did Bush so badly misjudged Vladimir Putin? \nLook, let's face it. Bush is repulsed by Donald Trump because, number one, Trump is more of an economic nationalist. And number two, Trump's election was a repudiation of both of the Bushes and the Clintons. And also, of course, W is still smarting from Trump's trouncing his baby brother, Jeb, in the primaries. \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Poor Jeb, he's doing other commercial of me. This guy, he is a maniac. This poor guy, I feel sorry. He's like a lost soul. You know, this poor, pathetic, low-energy guide. \nYou can go back. You interrupted. You apologize, Jeb? Again -- I know you're trying to build up your energy, Jeb, but it's not working. \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nINGRAHAM: My God, that was so funny. So, it's to be expected -- come on, that was brutal. That the Bushes would return to their natural habitat after all these years, places where no unquestioned international trade deals or the massive flood of humanity into our country. \nBut it's painfully obvious that the bushes were never comfortable with conservatives of the Reagan, Buchanan, Gingrich, or certainly not the Trump variety. They are comfortable, however, well, cozying up to the Obamas or hanging out with the Clintons. \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nBUSH: I don't know if that makes any sense. He told me he used some big birds. \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Used properly. So, President Bush -- \nBILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT: This is the point where I reach my back pocket to make sure my billfold is still there. I don't know any big words. \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nINGRAHAM: Isn't that sweet? Isn't that nice? It brings back such great memories. Let's get back to the proposition we put out at the beginning of the show. Why is George W. Bush suddenly so vocal? You weren't going to talk about successive presidents. \nWell, I think it might have something do with the economy taking off. Of course, the current market correction notwithstanding, 70 percent of registered voters in a new Quinnipiac poll essay the economy is good or excellent under Trump. \nThe simple act on that Trump's approval ratings are up to 40 percent, and an economist you go survey had him at 45 percent. Then you throw in an incredible state of the union, the unraveling of this ridiculous Russian investigation -- we will get into more of that with Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr, they feel now they need to respond. \nThat what Trump is doing is actually working. The president should wear the tired Bush critiques as a badge of honor. Trump is doing what previous administrations were unwilling or unable to do. \nAnd President Bush himself should know by now, come on, there is no constituency for perpetual military intervention, open borders, and totally unplaced international trade deals. \nMr. President, George W. Bush, your brother ran on that platform, and the people chose Trump, and that's the ANGLE. \nMeanwhile, let's shed some light on the Democrats glaring hypocrisy in accusing Republicans of undermining the Mueller investigation, as I just alluded to. Now, you recall Democrats did everything they could to undermine Ken Starr's Whitewater investigation into misdeeds by President Clinton, and you compare what Democrats are saying now with what they said back then. \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) \nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: There is a growing concern, I can tell you, in the Senate, in the sense that Mr. Starr is now operating out of any sense of reasonable behavior. \nHILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We get a politically motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right wing of opponents of my husband who has literally spent four years looking at every phone bill -- looking at every telephone call we've made, every check with ever written. \nREP. JOAQUIN CASTRO, D-TEXAS: This is a president who, on many issues, is basically beyond shame at this point. So, any sense of fairness or thoroughness for the sake of the investigation, I think, is questionable from the White House. \nREP. JERROLD NADLER, D-N.Y.: He is trying to distract attention from the Russian investigation and to discredit whatever Mueller says in the end. \n(END VIDEO CLIPS) \nINGRAHAM: I love that. Let's go to the man who was in the eye of the storm back then, former independent counsel, Ken Starr joins us from Washington, and Harvard law professor emeritus, Alan Dershowitz is in Miami. \nNow, guys, before we get into the Russia probe, I need to get your thoughts on this uproar over the Staff Secretary Rob Porter. He is now accused by a couple of ex-wives of indecent behavior, and this was an absolute firestorm in the White House briefing room today. \nProfessor Dershowitz, your reaction to the pretty quick takedown of Rob Porter? \nALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS: Well, I want to make a legitimate point. I think anybody who is accused by the \"Me Too\" people or anybody else and who denies it should have an opportunity to make their case, to present their argument. \nIt used to be that it was a she-said/he-said dispute, now it is a she-said and you can't even respond dispute. Both sides have to be heard. A process has to be put in place, whether in the White House, in Congress, anywhere else. \nWhether it is a Republican, like in this case, or a Democrat like Al Franken, there has to be an opportunity for both sides to present evidence and there has to be a fair process for determining who is telling the truth. \nSometimes it is obvious, sometimes it's clear, but even in the Bill Cosby case, where it seems so obvious to everybody, the jury came back with a hung jury. So, we need to have a process. We can't suspend due process just because there is a movement afoot that is making some very, very important points, but we need due process. \nINGRAHAM: Judge Starr, now the move seems to be to take down General Kelly because Kelly has worked side-by-side by him, even as one of his ex-wives said, I don't want him to lose his position in the White House. \nHe is incredibly smart, incredibly dedicated to his job, but I personally had -- they had a bad relationship, according to her. But now they are saying Kelly has got to go because Kelly actually stood up for his integrity because, as Alan Dershowitz said, these were accusations, haven't seen a photo or anything like that I guess. \nKENNETH STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Right, General Kelly, I think, was waiting for the evidence, and when the evidence came in, from what we know, he responded, and he responded decisively, which is what you would expect of a good military man. \nLet me add to what Alan said, and I agree to what we said, we need to be reminded in this country as we were reminded by Felix Frankfuther (ph) and many other justices and great jurors that the history of liberty in the United States is largely the history of procedure. Throw away procedure, throw away due process, and you have a very different kind of state. \nYou do not have a rule of law system. It is precious, and so rushes to judgement are to be avoided. So, let's get the evidence, evaluate, and assess the evidence. I think, from what we know, that's what General Kelly was doing. \nINGRAHAM: Yes. Let's move on from that to what is happening today -- to what is happening today in the Russian investigation. Professor Dershowitz, we now know that the Clintons paid for that dossier. It looks like now Sidney Blumenthal was involved, an old Clinton hand. \nJudge Starr knows about him very well, was funneling information to Christopher Steele as well. Some of it looks like it ended up in that dossier, or a second dossier that ends up funneling and in some way, shape, or form to that FISA judge. \nAnd yet Democrats will say, well, that is not dispositive. The search warrant to follow Carter Page was not only based in part on that dossier. So, you can't throw the baby out with the bathwater. \nSTARR: Well, we don't know what the FISA court decided, how much weight they gave anything. We don't know how much weight was given by the FISA court to any particular aspect. \nWhat we do know is that people who file an application, x party in front of a court have a special obligation to present all sides and to make sure that if they are relying on something, and they know there are questions about his credibility because of its source. \nThey have an obligation to prevent it fulsomely to the court. Now there is a footnote apparently in the application that does say that it came from a partisan source. That is not good enough. \nYou need to present -- you need to act as if the defense is presenting their side. You have an obligation to present both sides of the issue. Again, as Ken said, it is all about process. \nProcess is the way in which we achieve process, and I think there are problems with the process. I want to hear both sides of the issue, but at the moment, I think there was a breakdown of process. \nINGRAHAM: Judge Starr, as a former federal appellate court judge, when you think about this FISA judge, we don't know who it is. I guess, there were a number of judges involved in reviewing these applications, if a material fact had been withheld in that application to spy on an American citizen and a material fact is, the opposition candidate paid for the dossier among other things, is there any recourse for the judge at this point? \nIs there sanctions that can be filed against certain Justice Department attorneys? We had a guest on the other night who said he thought there could be ethical issues for the FBI and maybe even criminal charges if, indeed, there was a conspiracy to keep this information. \nDERSHOWITZ: Well, it's serious. Let's not rush to judgment. Let's be consistent and say, we need to know how that FISA application for the renewal was, in fact, prepared. Who prepared it, what did they know, when did they know it? \nI do think this is very serious for the reasons that Alan stated. There's another dimension to this, the FISA regime was designed to provide a judicial check on what might otherwise be an untrammeled executive excess of potential abuses. \nAnd so, there is a very special -- call it a fiduciary relationship that I think it's very deep, probably as deep as it gets. There always should be honesty and transparency with the court. \nThere is no excuse for anything, but it is all the more sensitive when you are talking about the power of the executive branch to spy on Americans -- \nINGRAHAM: Go back and read your emails. There is one more sound bite I want to play for you guys. Professor Dershowitz, this was Eric Holder, former attorney general, speaking out today. Let's watch. \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nERIC HOLDER, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: If one looks at the dismissal of James Comey and the reasons by the president told Lester Holt he did that, if you look at the president's attempts to get people who were heads of the intelligence agencies to get involved in this matter, if you look at the president's as -- actions, I think you technically have a case of obstruction of justice. \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nINGRAHAM: Professor Dershowitz, your reaction to that very quickly? \nDERSHOWITZ: Well, I think he's wrong. President George Bush the first did practically the same thing when it came to the Iran contract. He pardoned Caspar Weinberger and a handful of other witnesses, nobody suggested obstruction of justice. A president can't obstruct justice, in my view, if you simply exercise his constitutional authority. He has to do something like perjury, destroyed evidence, pay hush money the way Nixon did. \nINGRAHAM: Eric Holder has an interesting way of looking at these facts, but I knew Dersh would get it right as usual. The dynamic duo, fantastic. Thank you so much. \nBy the way, it's ironic, don't you think, how the Democrats keep pedaling the small story of Trump's collusion with Russia, and meanwhile, the potential evidence of the Obama administration's actual collusion with Russia keeps growing. I'll give you the details when we come back. Stay there. \n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) \nINGRAHAM: An FBI informant is telling Congress that the Russian government paid millions of dollars to influence the Obama administration and then- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to approve the Uranium One deal. \nInformant Douglas Campbell is now saying that the money was to go from a U.S. lobbying firm that is, by the way, populated with it a bunch of former Clintonistas to the Clinton Foundation's Global Initiative and the plot thickens from there. Here is Ed Henry to put this new revelation in perspective for us. \nED HENDRY, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Laura, good to see. Fox has confirmed that this FBI informant as you mentioned Douglas Campbell spent four hours behind closed doors Tuesday answering questions from staffers on the Senate Judiciary panel as well as the House Government Oversight and Intelligence Committees. \nAnd he said in private that Moscow paid millions to that U.S. lobbying firm to try and influence then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even though she has insisted she was hands-off in this deal. \nThis was a major deal during the Obama years that allowed a Russian nuclear energy agency to gain a controlling stake in Uranium One, a Canadian-based company with mining interests in the Western U.S. \nA sweetheart deal in the end that led some Russian officials to tell this informant that the fix was in. \"The Hill\" newspaper reported that Campbell says (inaudible) Worldwide was hired by the Russians to influence the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton in particular, and they spent millions doing it. \nVictoria Toensing, a lawyer for the FBI informant told Fox that the Russians lay the groundwork for this deal after former President bill Clinton and Frank Justra (ph) a wealthy Canadian philanthropist and investor in Uranium One went to Kazakhstan in 2006. \nJustra (ph), a major donor of the Clinton Foundation said he later sold his stake before the deal went through and 18 months before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. She had the final say on this matter, but it first required approval by nine different government agencies. \nBut the former president received a $500,000 speaking fee and multi-million dollar donations floated into the Clinton Foundation from Justra, which critics have charged was payback. Hillary Clinton has insisted she had nothing to do with approving this and said this in an interview with WABC. \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nHILLARY CLINTON (via telephone): I had nothing to do with the decision. Now, that is fact. I had nothing to do with it. It was delegated to somebody else in the State Department, and nine people had to agree, and they all agreed from all of the different agencies in our government, and then two Republican governors had to agree. \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nHENRY: Now, Clinton's aides have said this was a GOP manufactured scandal, and Democrats on Capitol Hill say FBI officials have privately told them they have lost confidence in this informant. But remember, the Trump Justice Department has sent signals recently that Uranium One and other Clinton Foundation problems are getting new scrutiny -- Laura. \nINGRAHAM: Thanks so much for that report, Ed. Really helpful. Now let's get some insight into the seriousness of this informant's allegations and the budget battle. This thing has been mild all-day long. Rand Paul gave an unbelievable speech. We're going to hear about that. \nJoining us now from New York, I'm so happy he is on. He wrote a great column today, Dan Henninger, deputy editorial page editor of \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Dan, it is so good to see. \nBefore we get to the budget fiasco on Capitol Hill, I have to ask you about this Uranium One story, because Hillary Clinton all along has said she had no personal involvement in OK-ing this deal. She was one of nine different agencies that had to vote on this from the Committee on Foreign Investment, but she said it wasn't her personal deal. \nDAN HENNINGER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: She is trying to put some distance between (inaudible) and her as are the Democrats, who are now, such as Elijah Cummings, a Democratic congressman, suggesting that the Republicans are raising the issue of Douglas Campbell to distract from the Russian investigation. \nLet's get something clear. Most of the Russian inclusion story at this point is mainly conjecture. Meanwhile, the sale of Uranium One was approved by CFIUS, on which she sat, is a fact. \nAnd the story that Ed Henry, the fact that Henry laid out, about the relationship between the Clinton Foundation, (inaudible), and the owners of Uranium One is well known. And I might add one more thing, Laura. \nWe know that in 2015, the FBI set up an investigation into the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and various pay to play accusations. The Justice Department more or less shut that down in 2016, but \"The Washington Post\" reported last month that that investigation, led by four FBI offices into the Clinton Foundation, has been revived. So, possibly the FBI will get to the bottom of the Uranium One story. \nINGRAHAM: Well, another thing that is really interesting here is that the Clinton -- I think the Clinton spokesperson said that they weren't even aware of the FBI's investigation. Most of the CFIUS committee that approved this sale -- again, 20 percent of U.S. uranium production, bought by this Uranium One company, originally Canadian, bought by the Russians, Russian state-owned company named Rosatom, turned in to Uranium One (inaudible). \nAnd we didn't know there was a racketeering corruption influence pedaling investigation going on. Now to me, that seems like bizarre that they wouldn't know that the FBI is looking into this? \nHENNINGER: How could the State Department seriously argue that they didn't know that any of this was going on? Even back then, the FBI had offices in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, and Little Rock where the Clinton Foundation is headquartered starting this investigation. \nIt is just beyond belief that the Clinton Foundation at least wasn't advised that the FBI was making this investigation and surely that would have found its way to the secretary of state. \nINGRAHAM: All right, Dan, let's move to draining the swamp. What we thought was going to happen with the Republicans in charge of the House, the Senate, and the White House. We are instilling some fiscal responsibility in this budget process, but here we are again right up against the clock. Rand Paul gave a speech today on the Senate floor, it was unbelievable, let's watch a piece of it. \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nSENATOR RAND PAUL, R-KY.: Are you going to cheer for the Republicans and Democrats holding hands and having a trillion-dollar deficit, or are you going to say to yourself, hmm, I'm suspicious that the Republicans and Democrats are clasping hands and giving us a trillion- dollar deficit? \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nINGRAHAM: Dan, a trillion dollars added to the deficit, trillion dollars we are going to have to borrow. Your reaction? \nHENNINGER: Well, I'm kind of a mixed feeling about what Senator Paul is doing here. I certainly agree with him. We don't want to drive the deficit towards a trillion dollars, but this is really the 11th hour, literally, to be stepping in here and holding up this budget, which is really about finally extending sufficient funding to the U.S. military across two years. \nWhen the Defense Secretary Mattis came up there on Capitol Hill yesterday, and said, look, guys, if we don't get this money, we are going to continue of soldiers, pilots, killed in training exercises. We simply do not have what we need. They have to get that done. \nI do think there is a problem here. The government shutdown, that was owned by the Democrats last time it happened. I think they're going to stand back and point to Senator Paul, and say, it is your guy who is threatening to shut down the government now. He is taking political heat off the Democrats. \nINGRAHAM: Dan, do you know what he is doing? I talked to one of his people earlier tonight. They just want to vote on the amendment. They just want to vote on the amendment to stay within their budget limitations. If he gets that boat, then they will be able to go forward. They are just looking for a vote on an amendment. I don't know why they won't give him that vote. \nHENNINGER: Well, government is supposed to shut down at midnight. If they can do that, I think that we have to get that done. It's not so much they discretionary spending inside the budget. The real problem, as Senator Paul knows is the entitlement spending, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. \nINGRAHAM: Yes, always is. \nHENNINGER: We are not going to be able to do anything about that unless you get more than 51 senators in the Senate as we have now. \nINGRAHAM: All right, Dan Henninger, thanks so much. We are coming to you tonight from the city that we all love, wonderful New Orleans, but it has a lot of problems, a lot of violent crime, and a mayor who seems more intent on tearing down statues than keeping the citizens here safe. We debate that. \nAnd later, Franklin Graham on the vocal fate of Donald Trump. Stay there. \n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) \nINGRAHAM: We are in New Orleans tonight, the city at the heart of the battle over preserving American history and Confederate monuments. New Orleans has the worst murder rate, even worse than Chicago today, and more shootings per capita than Baltimore, if you can believe it. And Mayor Mitch Landrieu is on a crusade, not necessarily to stop crime, but to hide history. \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nMAYOR MITCH LANDRIEU, D-NEW ORLEANS: These monuments celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy, ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, ignoring the terror that it actually stood for. And after the civil war, these monuments were part of that terrorism as much as burning a cross on someone's lawn. They were erected purposely to send a strong message to all who walked in the shadows about who was still in charge in this city. \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nINGRAHAM: New Orleans took down four Confederate statues last may after the city council declared them in a public nuisance. There was no vote of the people. Landrieu called the effort a move toward healing. Let's discuss statues, the mayor's priorities, and what is next with Malcolm Suber who is a coordinator with the group called Take 'em Down NOLA, and Thomas Bruno. He's a board member of Robert E. Lee Monumental Association. \nMalcolm, let's start with you. So you must be pretty happy that you took down four statues. You got Jeff Davis down, Robert E. Lee is down. You got that liberty monuments down, and General Beauregard, you got him down. So you got four statues down, markers down. What's next for you? \nMALCOLM SUBER, TAKE 'EM DOWN NOLA COORDINATOR: Well, our name is Take 'Em Down NOLA, and we want to take them all down. There are 20 more statues that are dedicated to white supremacy in the city of New Orleans. We have hundreds of streets named and parks named for Confederate and white supremacists. And so we want to wipe the slate clean. And we have challenged the mayor from the very beginning, don't do a half job, let's do the whole job. If you really believe -- \nINGRAHAM: Malcolm, I want to jump in here for a second, because Jackson Square, that is New Orleans, Jackson Square. Do you say that Jackson square -- Jackson square is not New Orleans? \nSUBER: No, it's not New Orleans. \nINGRAHAM: Do you want Andrew Jackson to be eradicated from New Orleans. \nSUBER: Of course we want -- \nINGRAHAM: So Jackson is down. OK, let's move on. Would you like Thomas Jefferson, anything related to Thomas Jefferson -- \nSUBER: Of course Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, all of those racists, yes. \nINGRAHAM: George Washington has to go? Who else is left? Is Madison OK? Is James Madison OK with you? \nSUBER: No, he is not OK. He was a slave owner. He is not OK. \nINGRAHAM: OK. So we need to rename Washington, D.C., correct? \nSUBER: Yes, I would do that. \nINGRAHAM: OK, rename Washington, D.C. \nSUBER: That's not for me to determine. That's for the people of Washington -- \nINGRAHAM: No, we need to know, Malcolm, where you are coming from, and we just established it, thank you very much. \nLet's move on to Thomas. Thomas, time for you to talk on. Hold on, my friend. We got it. White supremacy, we got it. Let's go to Thomas. Thomas, what is your sense on this? \nTHOMAS BRUNO, ROBERT E. LEE MONUMENTAL ASSOCIATION: Well, Laura, thank you for having me, first of all. And I would like to say, I love the fact that Malcolm wants to allow Washington, D.C., to vote on the name of the capital. Why didn't he allow us to have a vote in New Orleans on the removal of the monuments? The mayor, the city council has decided for themselves on this issue -- \n(CROSSTALK) \nINGRAHAM: Hold on, let him speak please, Malcolm. Malcolm. Malcolm, my friend, you must let the other guest speaker. It is rude. Please let Thomas speak. Thank you. Go ahead. \nBRUNO: OK, so Malcolm says that these statues represent white supremacy. I'm not in a position to tell Malcolm what he should think about these statues. These are pieces of art. Folks are free to make their own interpretation of what they mean or don't mean. There are a variety of different ways of looking at these pieces. \nFor him to say that these are this way and that anyone who disagrees with that is wrong to me, it's absurd. These are pieces of art. They are created in a manner in which there are a multiplicity of ways of looking at them. And when historians look at these pieces of art, they have a variety of different ways of interpreting them. \nI have been around these pieces of art all of my life, and it never occurred to me for one second that they were symbols of white supremacy. In fact, Mitch Landrieu himself said, when he was challenged to take down the statues, Mitch said, what are you talking about? I don't know what you mean. These statues mean white supremacy? The reason that Mitch did not understand that is because a lot of folks in this city do not see the statues that way. \nINGRAHAM: Let's go back to Malcolm. Malcolm, Malcolm, hold on. Malcolm - - \nSUBER: Whether or not these things are insensitive to black people. And when these statues -- \nINGRAHAM: Malcolm, until the last, I don't know, two, three years -- I've come to New Orleans on and off for the last 20 years. Until the last about two years, I hadn't heard anyone talk about the statues in Charlottesville, in New Orleans, in New York, and I hadn't heard anyone until mostly outside agitators came in and said, guess what, history has to be eradicated. We have to rename every federal building, we have to completely change history and context, and we have to get rid of it all. I until the last couple of years had never heard it. \nBRUNO: This is the fundamental problem, because what is happening in the city is that one group of people is deciding for everyone else how we should think about a piece of art. This is, to me, the most frightening occurrence of this whole thing. \n(CROSSTALK) \nINGRAHAM: OK, talking over each other. \nSUBER: And they put them up without any input whatsoever from the black community. And now that we are the majority, it is up to us to decide what -- \nINGRAHAM: Malcolm, you are right. Malcolm, I completely agree. Malcolm, you're not going to believe this, but I agree with you. It is up to the people to decide. And if the people decide they want to remove the monuments, that is the will of the people. Don't ram it through at night and remove the statues and put them in a place -- we don't even know where those statues are. \nBRUNO: And we don't know what is going to happen to them. One of the things that is so shocking about the whole process is that the city council and the mayor never had any plan in place for what happened to the monuments. \nINGRAHAM: They didn't care. But we are all against the white supremacy but we all for history as well. Malcolm and Thomas, we'll have your back, have you on radio. Both of you were great, thank you so much. \nAnd President Trump, by the way, has made a remarkable transformation into, believe it or not, a powerful voice for faith. Franklin Graham is up next to give us some perspective today. \n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) \nINGRAHAM: President Trump delivered a powerful speech at the national prayer breakfast in Washington this morning. He emphasized our country's dependence on God. \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nTRUMP: In the courage of our fellow citizens, we see the power of God's love and work in our souls and the power of God's will to answer all of our prayers. When Americans are able to live by their convictions to speak openly of their faith and to teach their children what is right, our families thrive, our communities flourish, and our nation can achieve anything at all. \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nINGRAHAM: To the surprise of many, the president, a man not known for his faith before the election, has become the most powerful religious voice in the public arena. To react we are joined from North Carolina by evangelical leader Franklin Graham. It is so great to see you, Franklin. I thought the president today -- I thought he was mesmerizing. Donald Trump is the guy holding torch for God and Christianity, Judeo-Christian culture. It's stunning. \nREV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM, BILL GRAHAM EVANGELICAL ASSOCIATION: It is stunning. In my lifetime, I've never had a president like this. And he's not afraid to speak out about his faith. But this was the 66th prayer breakfast. It started, my father encouraged going back to President Eisenhower and others who worked on this at the very beginning, and every president since Eisenhower has come to this breakfast, and it is a bipartisan breakfast put on by Republicans and Democrats, and they work together. And these are men and women of faith who come together in a bipartisan way to put on this breakfast. \nAnd it shows you that Washington can function. We need, Laura, more Christians in Washington. We need more -- can you imagine if the majority of the House and Senate were God-fearing men and women? That they could argue their points, but at the end of the day they would come together and work for the good of all American people. \nWe need men and women in Washington who believe in God, who believe in his son, Jesus Christ, who took our sins to the cross, who died for our sins, who got raised to life. We need more men and women like this. And last year, I went across this country to every state capital asking people to pray for this country and encouraging Christians to run. And I didn't tell them what party to run for. They can be Democrat. They can be Republicans. But we need Christians at every level of government. And when Christians come together, this is what you see at the prayer breakfast. They come together and they work together. It was a great thing, Laura. I was glad to be there. \nINGRAHAM: At one point the president talked about how a year earlier he had asked for prayers for, I believe it was a little girl who was very, very ill, and he said, he was overwhelmed by the response, the prayer that had come in for her. And he reported that she was doing much better. That was a small moment. \nI personally, I felt the power of prayer at very difficult times. And The left doesn't understand that, Franklin, because they say, he's been married all these times, and he can have a foul mouth, he said these things in the past. How can this flawed man be this evangelical and Catholic leader in a way? How does that happen? How does God use people like that? And your response would be? \nGRAHAM: Donald Trump is not a perfect person. I certainly, I'm not a perfect person, and I would hate for somebody to hold me up as being the greatest example of the Christian faith or the Christian life. I've got many failures in my life and so does Donald Trump, but that doesn't stop me from believing in God and believing in his son Jesus Christ, and Donald Trump believes in God. And he believes in God's son Jesus Christ. \nAnd I appreciate the fact that he doesn't run away from his faith and he's willing to stand up in front of the whole world and let the world know where he stands, and he appreciates people praying for him. We need to pray. We are commanded to pray for all of those in authority, Laura, all of them. When Donald Trump won the presidency, he became my president and your presidency, and God orders us to pray for him. \nINGRAHAM: Franklin Graham, so great to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. \nAnd by the way, Nancy Pelosi's pandering knows no bounds. Up next, we are going to look at how she used her grandson to advance her own divisive racial agenda. Don't go away. \n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) \nINGRAHAM: Now, you would think Nancy Pelosi wouldn't stoop to using her own flesh and blood as a prop to push her radical agenda and racial politics, right? Think again. \n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: I'm reminded of my own grandson. He had a very close friend whose name is Antonio who is from Guatemala. And he has beautiful tanned skin and beautiful brown eyes and the rest. And this was such a proud day for me, because when my grandson blew out the candles on his cake, I said, did you make a wish? He said, yes, I made a wish. I said, well, what is your wish? He said, I wish I had brown skin and brown eyes like Antonio. It was so beautiful, so beautiful. \n(END VIDEO CLIP) \nINGRAHAM: She is not even making sense. I wonder who he is listening to around the house. Why is Nancy Pelosi focusing on a child's skin color? Is that what Martin Luther King asked of us? Why is that relevant? Content of character. \nThink about it. Her suggestion that brown skinned Guatemalans are preferable to white Americans, come on. This is cynical, the cynical standard operating procedure of the left. But look at what Pelosi is really doing. This entire stunt was meant to use race to achieve political power. That's all it is. \nBut while Nancy does her marathon improv act in four-inch heels on the House floor, well, guess what, the Dreamers are still stuck. At least more Americans now will know where Nancy really stands, no matter what color they may wish to be. We'll be right back. \n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) \nINGRAHAM: Before we leave you tonight, I wanted to share a little taste of Mardi Gras here in New Orleans with you. Look, there is some shots of a music parade rolling through downtown tonight. It was such an incredible, communal, and family celebration for the streets. I can't wait to experience my first Mardi Gras. I'm going to be waiting for that crew of Baucus this Sunday celebrating their 50th anniversary this year, what a party this place is. It is awesome. If you haven't been down to New Orleans for Mardi Gras, you haven't lived. The Arroyos are going to show us a good time. \nIn the meantime, the party is just starting in D.C. We are just one hour away from the federal government shutdown. Maybe we need to send Sazeracs to all these people, Sazeracs to Rand Paul, three Sazeracs to Rand Paul and he'll vote for anything. \nShannon Bream is up next. \nContent and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

        "text": "View 6 Items Courtesy of Sandy Cummings/Bingham family Stacy and Jason Bingham are pictured with their five children. Three of their kids have had heart transplants —the oldest daughter has had two. \nValentine’s Day 2018 will mark the five-year anniversary of 14-year-old Lindsey Bingham’s heart transplant, a heart she waited eight months for while being sustained by a Berlin Heart, a miniature, external pump. But that’s just one part of the miraculous story of the Jason and Stacy Bingham family. \nWith four heart transplants in their family over the past 12 years, the Binghams, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, have learned to be grateful for each day they've been given. \nLindsey, along with her older sister Sierra, 18, and younger brother Gage, 9, have dilated cardiomyopathy , a condition where the heart muscle enlarges and can’t contract normally to pump blood to the rest of the body, causing heart failure. Each of the three children has undergone heart transplants — Sierra has had two. \n“You hear stories of pioneers who were pushing their cart and they looked back and couldn’t figure out who was pushing it — I’ve felt that way sometimes,” said Stacy Bingham, their mother. “I don’t know how I had the strength to get through some of the stuff we did, but there was strength coming from somewhere.” \nThe family’s other two children, Megan, 16, and Hunter, 11, also have markers and are at risk for the disease, but their heart function has been normal so far. \nThe Binghams' deeply rooted faith and optimism have held them together as they’ve traveled back and forth from their home in Haines, Oregon, to Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford in Palo Alto, California, several times a year for more than a decade. Courtesy of Sandy Cummings/Bingham family Gage Bingham (middle) is the most recent of the Bingham children to have a heart transplant. He is pictured with his family on April 5, 2017. \n“If I start feeling grumpy about something happening in my life, I think about them,” said Sandy Cummings, producer of a MSNBC documentary about the family titled “Heartbreak: Saving the Binghams.” “I think, ‘Look at what the Binghams are handling, and they’re handling it so beautifully. I just need to be quiet.’\" \n'Something big coming' \nStacy Bingham told the Deseret News her personal journey with her children's sickness began nearly 12 years ago. She remembers sitting in bed one Saturday morning before the kids were awake and turning to her husband and saying, “I feel like there is something big coming because our lives are too perfect right now. We’re too happy.” \nIt wasn’t more than four or five months later, when her oldest daughter Sierra, then 6, got sick, she said. What started out as the flu soon became an airlift to the Stanford children’s hospital two months later, as Sierra was experiencing heart failure. She was placed on the heart transplant list and on Aug. 3, 2006, received a donor heart that saved her life. \n“I knew through her whole experience that whatever happened, if she was able to stay with us in this life or move on to the next, everything would be fine by the time the baby was born,” recalled Stacy Bingham, who was expecting her fourth child at the time. “And luckily, things worked out. That was such a strength to me.” \nTheir fourth child, Hunter, was born in California right after Sierra’s first transplant. Life slowly went back to normal, despite Sierra’s many hospital checkups. \nIn May 2012, Lindsey was unexpectedly diagnosed with the same disease as her older sister. She waited eight months in the hospital living on a Berlin Heart before receiving a new heart on Feb. 14, 2013. \nStacy said waiting with Lindsey in the hospital was one of the hardest points of the family's journey. They had watched two children they knew, who had come in after Lindsey, get transplants before her. Stacy, who as a mother felt a responsibility to hold her family together, was struggling and missing home. \nShe recalled a day when she picked up a copy of the Ensign, an LDS Church magazine. She found a talk by Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf in which he listed three ways to “find joy in the journey.” \n“That was exactly what I needed to hear,” Stacy Bingham said. “I wrote those three things down on a card and made them all pretty. I hung them in Lindsey’s bathroom and the Ronald McDonald House. We would look at those every day and remind ourselves that we need to find the good things about what’s happening.” \nExperiences like that, she said, helped her lift everyone else so they could keep going. \nIt was also during that time Sierra’s body began rejecting the heart she had received almost seven years earlier. Sondra Zenger, a family friend from Palo Alto, watched as Sierra and the family humbly handled her second transplant, which she received in summer 2015. \n“Instead of feeling bad for herself, she (Sierra) felt bad for the family whose heart she had and that she couldn’t hold on to it longer,” Zenger said. \nChallenges weren’t over yet. During the same summer, then-7-year-old Gage had to get a defibrillator added to an existing pacemaker and “never quite bounced back from that surgery,” Stacy Bingham said. \nIn November 2015, Gage was put on Heartware , a ventricular assist device. He wore the battery part in his chest and the monitor part in a little backpack. He carried around the backpack for almost 18 months — 512 days, to be exact — until his new heart came in. Finally, Gage’s heart transplant occurred on April 5, 2017. Courtesy of Sandy Cummings/Bingham family The Bingham family gathers around Gage, the youngest Bingham child, in his hospital room on April 5, 2017, the day of his heart transplant. \nThough the journey has never been easy, Stacy Bingham is quick to acknowledge the personal growth she and her family have experienced through their trials. \n“When we’re all together and going through it together, it’s not easy for anyone. It’s not easy for the kids who had to leave their friends behind and start a new school,\" Stacy said of the often long periods of time her family has spent in California waiting for their donor hearts. \"It’s not easy for the child that’s sick and has to not feel well and be restricted on things they can do. \n“When we go through those challenges and those changes together, especially with siblings, they end up supporting each other and helping each other and building each other up.” \nStrength beyond your own \nStacy Bingham said there have been “way too many tender mercies to deny God’s hand in everything.” Everywhere they turn, she said, there have been people to support them — from giving her husband a place to work when they were in California to rides to and from the airport. \nAnother strength, she said, has been her husband, especially as they’ve watched medical problems tear other marriages apart. \n“It’s certainly important that we rely on each other,” Stacy said. “That’s the only way we’ve been able to keep our marriage together. We rely on each other and we help lift each other up and go through it together, rather than one here in Oregon and the other there in California trying to live two different lives.” \nZenger said she has been amazed as Jason and Stacy, the “most well-rounded, strong, faithful\" people she knows, have stayed calm despite their children’s continual health challenges. \n“They fully understand that Heavenly Father gave them these children because he knew they could handle the situation given to them,” Zenger said. “Even more, that they were so grateful they were given these children to do the very best they could with them.” \nDr. David Rosenthal, medical director of the Heart Failure and Transplant Program at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford has worked closely with the Binghams since Sierra’s first surgery in 2006. \n“They are just really committed to taking care of their children,” Rosenthal said. “No matter what the news was that they got in clinic, or in the hospital, no matter how unexpected it was or how poor the timing of it was, their response was to roll up their sleeves and figure out how to deal with it.” \n“They have really left an imprint on the whole hospital. They are wonderful people,” he added. \nRob Daines, a home teacher and former seminary teacher of the Binghams in Palo Alto, has also been positively impacted by the family. He said, “I want to be just like them when I grow up.\" Provided by the Bingham family The Bingham family visits the Polynesian Cultural Center in August 2017. \n“I, like most of us, when we face a little adversity, we crumble, or lick our wounds a little, think ‘why me’ and start counting up the various indignities … but they were genuinely optimistic and happy,” Daines said. “I am a better person for having met them.” \nDaines reflected on a time he and his son went to home teach the Binghams when Gage was in the hospital. It was in the middle of a crisis and they couldn’t get into the room because of the big crowd of doctors, Daines said, so Jason met them in the lobby. \n“My son shared a scripture with him. Our job was to try to lift and give reason for hope, and Jason ended up inspiring us with his faithful resilience. He took things from the scripture my son and I didn’t see and ended up encouraging us and sending us on our way with more faith and optimism than when we came in.\" \nThe documentary \nThe Binghams' outlook on life has also continued to catch the attention of national media . \nOn Nov. 25, 2017, MSNBC aired a two-hour documentary called “ Heartbreak: Saving the Binghams ” about the family's journey from Sierra’s diagnosis in 2006 to Gage’s recovery in 2017. \nProducer Sandy Cummings had read about the Binghams' story in a newspaper written when Lindsey was waiting for her transplant and pitched the idea to \"Dateline,\" for whom she worked at the time. Although initially hesitant, the Binghams agreed to do the segment, Cummings said, because Jason wanted to increase awareness of the need of donor hearts. \nCummings ended up following the family around for five and a half years as the Binghams' story continued to unfold. She produced two \" Dateline\" segments as well as the documentary. Love, respect and faith held the Binghams together through the ups and downs, she observed. \n“What impressed me the entire time was that I never heard either one of them (Stacy or Jason), even under all that stress, say a harsh word to each other, or to one of the kids,” said Cummings. “They are incredibly strong and incredibly kind people, just impressive.” \nCummings said she hopes the documentary and the Binghams' inspiring story give hope to those who are struggling with medical issues while raising awareness for organ donation. \nLooking forward \nIn mid-January of this year, Gage and Lindsey went in for checkups at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford. Both are doing great and no problems were reported, Stacy Bingham said. Sierra goes back later this month. \n“We’re in a really good spot right now,” Stacy said during an interview in January. Courtesy of Sandy Cummings/Bingham family Stacy (middle left) and Jason Bingham (top right) are pictured with their five children, Sierra, Megan, Lindsey, Hunter and Gage. \nSierra, 18, is finishing her senior year. She’s on the dance team and wants to serve a full-time mission for the LDS Church. She hopes to get into BYU-Idaho and study nursing “so she can return that care she has received,” Stacy said. \nMegan, Hunter and Gage play basketball, while Lindsey plays volleyball. Every Friday, the family goes skiing together. The kids’ schedules keep the family busy. \n“We just try to live in the moment and take things as they come,” Stacy Bingham said. \nStacy and Jason Bingham don't normally talk about the future because they have found life to be unpredictable. They try not to dream too far ahead but Stacy Bingham says they do hope. They hope the hearts their children have will last them the rest of their lives. They also hope their kids won't have to go through the same medical problems with their own children. ",

She found someone who needs it Mike Argento , margento@ydr.com Published 12:33 p.m. ET Feb. 8, 2018 CLOSE Lisa Little's kidney, nicknamed Mabel, loved running. Before becoming a living donor, Little wanted to run one last 5K with Mabel. Kate Penn Buy Photo Kim Naill Storm, inspired by her father, decided to donate a kidney to a needy recipient. She found a donor, on Facebook. (Photo: Paul Kuehnel, York Daily Record) Buy Photo CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Sixteen years ago, Kim Naill Storm's family gathered in a small room at the Hershey Medical Center for a meeting with a doctor. Her father, David Naill, had been in a car accident near Dillsburg while on his way to work at Penske Truck Leasing on Jan. 18, 2002. He had been on life support in the hospital for 13 days, and the family had to review its options. They decided to take David off life support and allow him to go home. The family had a deep faith. David had been active in their Pentecostal church, and his reward for this life lay at the end. The doctors talked to the family about organ donation. David wasn't an organ donor and the doctors told the family that if they wished, they could make the decision for him, that his organs could live on to save lives, or at least make some lives more tolerable. The family didn't discuss it much, still in shock from the possibility of losing David. They went with what they believed David's wishes would have been and declined to donate his organs. Had he wanted to donate his organs, they reasoned, he would have designated that on his driver's license. More: Joseph Stalin's daughter lived in East Berlin, briefly Over the years, Kim, now 42 and living south of Hanover and working at Sweet Frog in town, thought about her family's decision. In the moment, it was a tough decision to make, clouded by the grief and shock the family was feeling at the time of David's untimely death at the age of 50. With time, though, she came to believe that it would have been a good thing to do to donate his organs. The joy it would have given other families would not have lessened their grief. But knowing that something good could have come from his death could have helped them heal as time passed. Occasionally, Kim would mention to friends and family that she was thinking about donating a kidney to someone in need. She would say it in passing, nothing too serious. She just thought she'd like to have a chance to do that, to help someone else out. It was just something she wanted to do. And she wanted to do it while she was still alive. She didn’t like the idea that her family's sorrow and grief could be someone else's joy. It was in the back of her mind when she saw a Facebook post from a friend asking people to post their bucket list items. Among the different dreams and aspirations – climbing mountains, running marathons and such – was Kim's post. Her bucket list was short. She wanted to donate a kidney to somebody in need. She signed up for the tests at the Hershey Medical Center. She passed all of them, except one – the psychological exam, necessary because, as Kim said, it's not common that people volunteer to have a surgeon cut into a healthy body and remove a vital organ. The test, though, hung her up. Like many people, she takes anti-depressants, and that fact caused the doctors to pause. The doctors told her she could donate blood, or bone marrow, and make a difference that way. As Kim said, \"I wanted to go bigger.\" Kim had been so committed to donating a kidney, the news was devastating. She cried all the way home. CLOSE Kim Storm describes how the decision to make a living organ donation began when her father was taken off life support. Paul Kuehnel Kim, undaunted, looked into private donation. Instead of donating a kidney that would go to the next person on the transplant list who matched her blood and tissue type, she could find somebody who needed a kidney and just donate it directly, by-passing some of the red tape and the psychological testing. More: A York County chainsaw carver's photo keeps showing up on dating sites. But it's not him. She didn't know anyone personally who needed a kidney. So she took to Facebook, and on Feb. 1, on the Hanover Helps page, posted: \"Serious post. I am looking to donate my kidney to a recipient in need. If you know somebody that could use a Type A positive kidney, please reach out to me. All necessary testing has already been completed by me. Thank you.\" It took a few days, but she found someone. *** Harry Rinehart developed kidney disease about five years ago. The disease progressed, and for the past three and a half years, he has been on dialysis. He developed other complications and recently wound up in the hospital with a sepsis infection. He needs a new kidney and has been on the transplant list for three years now, his wife, Joann, said. The list is long, much longer than the number of available kidneys. So all he could do was wait. Now and then, Joann would post updates of her husband's health on Facebook, asking friends to send their prayers. The Rineharts lean on their faith to get them through the days. Harry, 63, is a Pentecostal preacher. More: See YDR's latest subscription offer A Facebook friend – someone Joann went to school with but hadn't seen in decades – sent her a link to Kim's Facebook post offering a kidney. The friend is Kim's husband's aunt and just happened to know the Rineharts and their plight, learning about it on Facebook. Joann got in touch with Kim via Facebook Messenger. They spoke on the phone. It appears Harry and Kim might be a match, but they have to undergo more tests to make sure. And Harry has to recover from his complications. It could be a few months before he gets Kim's kidney. If it all works out, Kim would get to fulfill her wish. And Harry would get a new lease on life. *** Kim says her family supports her decision. \"Nobody's said 'don't do it,' not that it would matter anyway because I feel so strongly about it,\" she said. She has no fear of surgery. Though she was raised Pentecostal, she drifted from the faith. Her quest to donate a kidney has restored her faith, strengthened when she learned that the Rineharts share her faith. Joann Rinehart says Kim's offer is humbling. \"It's so unselfish, that somebody you don't know would give you a part of her body,\" Joann said. \"It's amazing.\" She said, \"We've been praying and waiting for a kidney for three years and along comes Kim. Just goes to show you that God works in mysterious ways.\" Reach Mike Argento at 717-771-2046 or at mike@ydr.com. Facebook ",

        "text": "Close SAFD firefighter battling rare disorder A rare disease that can be challenging and even debilitating is threatening a San Antonio firefighter's very way of life. The diagnosis has impacted both his family at home and at the fire house. Leah Durain, KENS 9:03 AM. CST February 09, 2018 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nA rare disease that can be challenging and even debilitating is threatening a San Antonio firefighter’s very way of life. The diagnosis has impacted both his family at home and at the firehouse. \nOne of the mottos of the San Antonio fire department is “our family protecting your family.” For more than 12 years, Brad Hauer has been protecting thousands of families across San Antonio. The community is now rallying around him and his family in a time of need. GoFundMe | Click: Brad Hauer Fund \nThere is a hole in Station 42. The damage is not to the building but to the team. Hauer’s bunker coat hangs in the bay locker but Brad is not walking the halls, cracking his usual jokes. The San Antonio firefighter is in the hospital facing a different kind of fight. \n“We’ve hit a really hard spot but we’re trying to stay as positive as we can and work through it,” said Margo Hauer, Brad’s wife. \nIn December, Brad found out he has stiff person syndrome , or SPS. It’s an autoimmune disorder that triggers debilitating muscle spasms. There is no cure, only treatments. \n“The week of Thanksgiving the spasm started happening, total body spasms,” said Margo. “It literally knocked him to the ground.” \nMargo married Brad less than a year ago. She had three children; so did he. They blended into one big “Brady Bunch” family. Then came another big transition for the Hauer family. \n“There’s a lot of frustration there when literally one day you’re fine and then your life is ripped away from you,” said Margo. “You have to take a new route, learn a new normal in life. I’ve taken on a completely different role in my life but I wouldn’t change a thing. I would do this one hundred times over for that man.” Blood Drive for Brad Hauer | Click: Feb 24th \nBrad is in the hospital for the third time since December. Doctors are using a technique that involves plasma transfusions. Once Brad is discharged, protecting his immune system is a top priority. His family will sanitize their hands when entering and leaving the home. \nBrad will also undergo home transfusions of immunoglobulin. The substance is made up of thousands of plasma donations which offer temporary protection to his weakened immune system. \nMargo is staying home full-time to care for Brad and their six kids. They are not the only family stepping up while Brad focuses on his health. His fellow firefighters are leaning in as well. \n“It’s a big blow, it’s very painful and difficult to watch someone you love and care about suffer that way,” said Battalion Chief Thomas McNulty. “Everyone has their own special gifts and their own special ways that they can contribute and if everyone does a little bit we can get a lot done.” T-Shirt Sale | Click: Rock Hard Hauer \nBattalion Chief McNulty hopes Hauer can one day return to station 42 in a new role. \nIn the meantime, the family assistance program has put together a t-shirt sale and GoFundMe page to help pay for some of the Hauer’s bills. \nA blood drive in Brad’s honor is also taking place February 24 th . \n© 2018 KENS-TV ",

        "text": "Preserving fertility in women with cancer ANI | 23 hours ago | New Delhi [India], Feb 9 (ANI): Many cancer treatments affect the ability to become pregnant, temporarily or permanently.\nFertility preservation (FP) is an effort to retain the fertility of cancer patients, thereby improving their quality of life. \n\"Due to the tremendous rise in risk of cancer, it becomes essential to opt for preserving fertility. After the cancer treatment, a woman's body might recover naturally and produce mature eggs that can be fertilized. However, the medical team may recommend waiting for six months to two years before trying to get pregnant. The length of time depends on the type of cancer and the treatment used,\" said Dr. Priti Gupta Fertility \nIVF Expert, First Step IVF Clinic, New Delhi. \nFertility Preservation Options: \n-Egg freezing \nEgg freezing is a well known method of preserving fertility in women. It might be a good choice for women who do not have a partner. For egg freezing, mature eggs are removed and frozen. Once the woman is ready to become pregnant, the eggs can be thawed, fertilized, and implanted in her uterus. \nA new method of freezing called vitrification has made egg freezing more efficient and successful. Another alternative could be to freeze half the eggs and fertilize the rest with sperm from a donor and then freeze embryos. \n-Embryo freezing \nThis is the most established and successful method of preserving a woman's fertility. Mature eggs are removed from a woman's ovaries and fertilized in the lab. This is called in-vitro fertilization (IVF). \nThousands of sperm are put in a sterile dish with each egg. Sometimes one sperm is injected into each egg .The embryos are then frozen to be used after cancer treatment. A woman will have a better chance of a successful pregnancy if several embryos are stored. \n\"For women who are less than 35, a single embryo transfer is the safest way of using IVF to get pregnant so as to avoid multiple pregnancies,\" said Gupta. \n-Ovarian tissue freezing \nThis process involves removal of all or part of one ovary by laparoscopy. The ovarian tissue is usually cut into small strips, frozen, and stored. Ovarian tissue freezing lets women freeze a vastly larger number of immature eggs for future use. When frozen ovarian tissue is re-implanted into the body and regains its functions, immature frozen eggs within the tissue start developing normally. \nPost cancer treatment, the ovarian tissue is placed in the pelvis. Once the transplanted tissue starts to function again, the eggs can be collected and fertilized. The ovarian tissue does take blood supply and she is to produce hormones after its transplanted. \n-For women who are not fertile after cancer treatment \nDonor egg is an option for women who have a healthy uterus but do not have any eggs. Egg donation is often a successful treatment for women who can no longer produce healthy eggs. \nAlso, any woman who has a healthy uterus can maintain a pregnancy by the utilizing the donor embryos.

        "text": "Cameroon Gas Project Brings Royalties For Shareholders, But Tainted Water and Brutalities To Locals Cameroon Gas Project Brings Royalties For Shareholders, But Tainted Water and Brutalities To Locals Share \nAs the first rays of daylight pierced a thick haze blanketing the Ndogpassi neighborhood, several dozen angry men appeared, seemingly from nowhere. They formed a human barrier across the main entrance to a natural gas power plant in the east of Douala, Cameroon’s economic capital. \nSome of the men laid across the roadway, forcing employees of the plant to abandon their cars and enter the facility on foot. As daylight emerged and a crowd of onlookers grew, the men began to sing Cameroon’s national anthem. \nThat episode, in the summer of 2016, signaled the start of a long protest against Gaz du Cameroun (GDC), fueled by accusations of corruption, payoffs to public officials, and lying to the community about the start-up and operation of this important power plant, which is actually owned by the British Victoria Oil and Gas, plc based in London. \nThe principal complaint: the promise of a substantial number of permanent jobs for local residents has gone unmet. \n“GDC says that local residents aren’t qualified. Yet, at the same time, the company is training people from outside, hiring them and refusing to do the same for us,” said a protestor in the crowd. He wouldn’t give his name to a stranger, citing fear of reprisals from the security forces. “Only two people from the neighborhood, out of forty, have been hired by GDC for the new drilling operations.” \nTo cut the tension, authorities brokered a meeting between the disgruntled residents and company officials. \nA month later another group of residents took to the streets, protesting that the company brought on local youth only as temporary hires, and groundskeepers. Today the community is overwhelmed by youth unemployment and plagued by a foul odor from the drinking water, damage to the local environment and brutal police retaliation when they speak out. \nLocal complaints and accusations of broken promises to the community have not prevented gas-industry analysts from heaping praise on VOG’s Cameroonian affiliate. The Petroleum Economist, the prestigious London-based trade publication, lauded VOG’s management of Cameroon’s natural gas production facility as exemplary. Upon receiving the “Energy Company – Small cap of the Year” award for 2015, Kevin Foo, founder and executive director of VOG, said the prize was testimony to the dedication and hard work of the teams in Douala and in London. \nAnd indeed, when Cameroonian President Paul Biya first launched the project in 2013, residents of Ndogpassi welcomed the gas plant as a ticket out of poverty. \nA two-year investigation by 100Reporters has found that the project, though managed by President Biya, has failed to pay royalties, training fees and taxes to the Cameroonian treasury, even as it made payments to investors totaling millions of dollars. \nNow, after years of silence, the Cameroonian government admits the plant’s owners have missed tax payments to the Cameroon treasury, and has identified possible violations of resource, Social Security and environmental rules. In March, it threatened to terminate the contract with the VOG subsidiary that runs the plant. Executives for the company and its various international subsidiaries declined to comment about the government’s accusations. \nBefore the construction of this power plant, which covers some 20 square miles, industrial and business users in Douala burned heavy and expensive fuel oil. And these users had to deal with regular supply interruptions that hurt production. Natural gas was seen as the solution: clean, reliable and less expensive, especially for businesses with their own generators. \nTwo exploratory wells in Ndogpassi yielded enough proven reserves to satisfy consumption needs in the region through 2043. \n“Energy is at the heart of any development process,” Biya said in November 2013. “Without it, there can be no industry, no transformation of raw materials, and therefore no modern economy. There was a time when it was said that the infantry was the queen of battles. Today, one might say, paraphrasing the formula, that energy is the queen of the battle for development and progress. Together, this battle, we will win it.” \nThe Ndogpassi plant was a rare win on the energy front for Biya, whose earlier efforts to foster energy production in Cameroon had largely failed. \nYet even from its start, the Ndogpassi plant, designed to tap identified reserves of up to 11.3 billion cubic meters in the region, was met with questions: Could the government strike a deal that would truly benefit the national treasury? Or would accusations of corruption, opacity and favoritism mar this project, as they had so many others in the field? \nOn November 15, 2013, President Biya, dressed in a dark suit, strode across the rocky red ground of Ndogpassi. Accompanied by his wife, Chantal, various government officials and VOG officials, Biya officially launched the drilling operations. \nBiya lauded the $100 million project as emblematic of a presidential policy of “Great Ambitions.” \nThe project augured well for the neighborhood, many of whose 20,000 residents lacked reliable access to safe drinking water, decent healthcare, land ownership or the Internet. \nAntoine Tebu woke up early that day to witness Biya’s opening ceremony, and joined in cheering for the president. Tebu is a neighborhood chief – a citizens’ representative – and owns a welding shop. He is also the community’s spokesman before the gas drilling company. \nTebu said the euphoria was short-lived. Soon, soldiers from the Rapid Intervention Battalion (BIR), an elite division of the Cameroonian army, arrived and were posted at the facility. Tebu said they erected a barrier of cement-filled barrels 10 meters from the entrance to the GDC facility, and went on to commit acts of violence against civilians. They barred local moto-taxis from the area, and struck civilians who ventured near. \n“They beat the motorbike drivers worse than they beat prisoners, so badly that blood poured from their nostrils. They then forced them to walk on all four before letting them go. They even beat the motorbike passengers,” Tebu said, adding that during this time some drivers, fearing reprisals, refused to transport residents to the plant. \nAlain Tedom, 28, is the third of Tebu’s seven children. He remembered that he was celebrating his new degree in banking when he witnessed a horrific scene: \n“A motorbike driver had crossed the blocked zone to drop off a passenger. On the way back, as he was crossing the barrier, a soldier stopped him, beat him and ordered him to hand over his motorbike. The driver refused,” Tedom said. “They continued beating him. Only when he was in very bad shape did he finally abandon his motorbike.” \nResidents complained about this incident, but witnesses told 100Reporters that beatings continued nevertheless. And a letter to GDC from the local chief, obtained by 100Reporters, describes assaults by soldiers on local residents. — “to beat them, to make them drink dirty water. They enter bars and garages, pulling out their guns to threaten bar patrons and garage employees.” \nOn July 4, 2016, the report found, a BIR soldier kicked down the entrance to the garage owned by a Mr. Tato, which was located a few steps from the gas facility. After threatening the employees, the soldier “enters the office, takes out a large knife and attempts to stab the office agent in the stomach but misses, and when pulling back the knife, he cuts (sic) his own hand.” \nAs with other complaints by area residents, this incident was reported to authorities and GDC operators, but went unanswered. \nContacted by email, VOG initially said it would respond to questions from 100Reporters. Ultimately, however, the company declined to comment. \nAs supreme chief of the army, President Biya created the special military unit in the early 2000s. The force is under his direct command, and has a long record of complaints about alleged abuse of civilians. \nIn a telephone interview, Colonel Didier Badjeck, the Cameroonian army director of communications, said he was not familiar with the BIR units posted at the gas facility and therefore could not comment on the accounts of violence at their hands. \n“But, they (the soldiers) are there on instruction from their hierarchy,” he noted. \nIn the mid-1950s, Ndogpassi was just a village when the French company Elf-Aquitaine discovered a large reserve of natural gas beneath the surrounding bush. At that time, this type of gas had little commercial value on the international market. Elf was looking for oil, so after digging several exploratory wells, the company abandoned the project. \nThe Cameroonian government then accelerated a wholesale relocation of the local population to allow RDL – now known as GDC – to begin gas-drilling operations. \nSeated on a wooden chair in his office, Chief Tebu recounts that during construction, GDC trucks damaged the community’s water wells. In response, GDC dug a new community well, inaugurated in March 2012 by Jonathan Scott-Barrett, then general director of the company. \n“Everyone who was there drank that water. From that time, the water has had a foul odor that worries the locals,” Tebu said. \nGDC said it spent some $25,000 on the well. But Tebu said that the company did not drill deep enough to reach clean water. In a 2014 financial report the company said it has spent more to maintain the well, but did not provide specific numbers. \nWhen local residents noticed the well water’s poor quality, some began to use it only for washing dishes and doing laundry. Others, like Frank Tchinda, stopped using the water altogether, turning instead to other neighborhood wells constructed by locals. \n“You would have to be blind to not see that this water is bad. It stinks,” Tchinda, 23, shouted during an interview, pointing to the yellow stains on the white tile around the borehole. \nThe company and the government say the water has been thoroughly tested at the Pasteur Center laboratory in Cameroon. That may be, residents say, but they remain suspicious, saying that the GDC well is the only one in the area that produces foul-smelling water. \nTebu said he first noticed the odor when his job was delivering fresh water to the plant. He said GDC officials ordered him not to use water from the community well it had dug. Today the plant has its own water well. \n“In 2015 the plant was operating at only 20 per cent capacity, and GDC registered $21.4 million in revenues – up more than 112 percent from the previous year. Gas went through pipelines buried across Doualato reach local food processing companies, breweries, electricity providers and foundries”. \nAs production increased, GDC began hiring local workers. Tedom, Tchinda and other residents were paid to clear brush around the facility. “Soon after, they got rid of us,” Tedom said. Just two months in, locals turned up for work one morning, only to find the entrance blocked. A GDC official said that London had ordered a halt to hiring of temporary local workers. \nNevertheless, the company’s financial report for the year said that it had “hired” 90 local residents. \nSince then, GDC has brought on local workers for temporary stints via text messages. One message on April 20, 2016 was typical: “Good morning. Please be at the guard station … at 8 a.m. for a one week job. Bring your helmets and shoes.” Recently, the company has contracted with another traditional chief in the neighborhood to recruit local temporary workers. \nLocals complain that they had been promised permanent jobs. In January 2016 the “unemployed youth of Logmayangui,” with Tedom and Tchinda at the top of the list of signees, sent a letter to the General Director of GDC. They complained that the company only hired outside contract workers for grounds and warehouse work. Encouraged by local chiefs like Tebu, local youth demanded stable, permanent jobs. They also denounced what they saw as nepotism at the plant, claiming new hires, coming from distant regions of Cameroon, were all family or friends of GDC employees. \nGDC told Tedom it would consider the complaints when it came to work on new wells at the plant, Tedom said. But today, locals say the company continues to sign permanent contracts with English-speaking workers from Cameroon’s two Anglophone regions, leaving the locals with the temporary work. \n“I would like a permanent job at the plant to help me pay for my studies,” said Tchinda, who is close to earning a woodworking certificate. \nJobs are not the only issue for critics of the gas facility. \nDuring a meeting between company officials and local residents, Tebu said he realized that the Cameroonian government is also missing tax revenue from the Ndogpassi gas project. \nTebu said that local contractors pay taxes normally, but when GDC hires, it pays fewer taxes. Tax authorities can easily control local contractors but it is difficult to extract taxes from GDC, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands. \nGovernment documents obtained by 100Reporters suggest that the operators of the gas plant have failed to meet its fiscal obligations. \nAccording to the concession contract, RSM must pay the government a fee each year during the exploration phase and then a larger annual fee during the production phase of the project. One such fee is earmarked for training Cameroonian nationals to work in the petroleum industry. The total owed is roughly $170,000, which has never been paid. \nGDC is jointly owned, with VOG or its subsidiary owning a 55 per cent stake, RSM Production Corp. holding 40 per cent, and the Cameroonian government owning 5 per cent. \nReached by telephone, Jack Grynberg said, “I have paid nothing. It is the responsibility of the operator, VOG, to pay that money.” Later, in an email to 100Reporters, Grynberg said all questions concerning the Ndogpassi gas project should be addressed to VOG, as operator of the concession for GDC. \nAccording to a report of the Cameroon Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, GDC is responsible for “making (liquidating) all payments due in place of (instead of)” RSM, and for integrating all monies paid on behalf of RSM into its fiscal declarations. But neither GDC’s financial reports nor its reporting to the government make any mention of training fees paid to the government of Cameroon. These fees for training programmess alone would now amount to $170,000 – three years of exploration and five years of production. \nGovernment reports, based on statements submitted by oil and gas corporations, also indicate that between 2009 and 2011, GDC did not pay land-use fees, or voluntary contributions associated with its workforce. In its 2014 statement to Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, GDC declared it had paid more than 8,400,000 Cameroonian francs, or $15,300 in voluntary social donations, but made no mention by name or by region of the beneficiaries of its largesse. \nGDC, the company extracting Cameroon’s natural gas, is listed in the British Virgin Islands, a territory that doesn’t require companies to declare revenues or beneficial owners. VOG registered its subsidiaries in six territories with weak or non-existent taxation: There are two in the British Virgin Islands, two in Guernsey, three in Kazakhstan, three in England and Wales, and one each in Russia and Cyprus. The Cameroonian subsidiary generates all the revenues for the entire group, according to an interim financial report filed by VOG financial report for 2017. \nThe company disputes the terms of the government concession, and has not paid fees and taxes in Cameroon. Meanwhile, the company has made millions of dollars in royalty payments and given no-interest loans to its subsidiaries. \nCameroon should receive royalty payments in the amount of 8 per cent of GDC’s monthly revenues, according to the concession contract. Despite annual revenue of more than $27 million in 2015, GDC indicated in its annual report that it would pay royalties to the state once it had recovered all “petroleum costs,” which include exploration costs, development costs, production costs, construction costs and all the other general operating expenses of the project. \nGDC confirms that it has not yet paid the Cameroonian government, because it has yet to recoup all its costs. This condition, which is not included in the contract, angers Cameroonian authorities. Rather, the concession agreement says the operator “shall pay to the State a proportional royalty at the rate of eight (8 per cent) for all levels of gas production.” \nIn its annual report, GDC reports that, “the interpretation by the group of what constitutes ‘petroleum costs’ has not been formally agreed upon by the Cameroonian government.” \nIn other forums, however, VOG, the operator of the Cameroon plant, paints a different picture. \nThe company’s 2016 Interim Financial Report states that as of June 2016, it had recovered its “petroleum costs” and returned 40 per cent of project shares to RSM. \nWhile VOG conditions its royalty payments to Cameroon on first recuperating its costs, the British multinational has consistently distributed royalties from the Cameroonian gas operation to its offshore subsidiaries. Cameroon Holdings Limited (CHL), one of the subsidiaries based in Guernsey, lists its only source of revenue as “GDC royalties.” According to VOG’s annual financial reports it pays royalties of up to 15 percent of GDC revenue during the lifetime of the Ndogpassi gas project to CHL. \nBramlin Limited, based in Guernsey for the duration of the gas project, is another subsidiary of VOG, and it receives royalty payments in the amount of 4.5 per cent of GDC revenue. \nAccording to a confidential document acquired by 100Reporters, Rodeo Resources Incorporated — another company related to Bramlin and VOG — also receives 1.2 per cent of GDC revenues for the life of the project. Additionally, Rodeo receives a $500,000 production bonus for each million cubic meters of gas and natural gas condensate produced at Ndogpassi, up to a total of $10 million. \nCompany officials at VOG declined to comment for this report. \nIn May 2017, the government charged that Cameroon lost more than $7 billion in illicit financial flows, including fraud and corporate tax evasion between 2003 and 2012. Lacking the necessary expertise to verify information, the government says it must rely on statements of companies like VOG about the production of gas and natural gas condensate extracted at Ndogpassi, the amount of earned revenue, the identities of the offshore entities, and revenue sharing. \nIn 2015, Cameroon joined 126 nations in an international agreement on transparency in tax matters. That was followed by a promise from the government to crack down on tax cheats. \n“The coming days will permit us to collect the information we need to stop fraudulent operators, even the most sophisticated,” declared Roland Atanga, head of legislation and international fiscal relations at Cameroon’s tax authority. The senior tax inspector notes in the journal, Tax News, that working collectively with other countries to fight fraud and tax evasion, Cameroon hopes to reinforce investor confidence and improve its international visibility. \nDespite the difficulties Cameroon has prying financial information from offshore oil and mining operations, the state continues to uphold Article 105 of the petroleum code, which keeps all oil, gas and mining contracts confidential. International groups have tried, without success, to convince Cameroonian authorities that these contracts must be transparent–published and made available to the public–in order to guarantee accountability. \nThe state-owned oil company, the Societé Nationale des Hydrocarbures (SNH), which represents the state in all oil and gas contracts, including the Ndogpassi concession, is itself an illustration of government opacity. The public corporation, whose board chairman is also secretary general for President Biya, does not publish statistics in open data format, according to international governance auditors. They’ve also complained that statistics submitted by SNH are not accompanied by narrative reports on the activities and regulation of the industry. \nIn addition to reports coming from the state oil and gas Company, Biya’s own legal advisor, Jean Fouman Akame, is on the Ndogpassi management committee. During an official visit to the gas facility in April 2015, Akame stated that he was satisfied with the project’s management. \nThe public treasury does not share this satisfaction. \nOn March 10, 2017, Adolphe Moudiki, Director General of SNH, sent a notice of termination of the concession contract to GDC. \nIn the notice, Moudiki says GDC has failed to share monthly income proportional to production, or pay concession and exploration fees or training costs totaling nearly $800,000. \nIn addition, the Director General of the SNH reproached GDC for not signing the agreement of participation of the State, not holding meetings with the government prescribed by the contract, and violating government rules on oil and gas exploitation. The government claims the company has changed the concession contract without notice, has sold natural gas to customers without permission or without government agreement on prices. All this has denied the government a due share of the plant’s revenue, he wrote. \nThe accusations come just as GDC applied for a license to operate a new gas block, and announced a planned, major expansion of operations in Cameroon. The government said the company first needs to settle accounts on the Ndogpassi project, and submit to an audit, as spelled out in its concession contract. \nSeveral government inspection missions to the gas facility have turned up other possible violations, the government said, such as not having a doctor for workers, an evacuation plan, or plans to deal with accidents. \nAs for the youths who took to the streets to demand work at the gas facility, they were detained by police for a few days. Now out, they vow to continue their protests until GDC offers them permanent jobs. \nChief Tebu, watching the sun sink below the horizon beyond the plant, despaired. “What are we going to do” about this plant?” he murmured.

        "text": "VOLUNTEER motorcyclists who deliver round the clock emergency supplies for hospitals and hospices have received a lifeline. \nMerseyside and Cheshire Blood Bikes have been named Merseyrail’s charity of the year for 2018. \nVice chairman and rider Simon Dennett, from Farnworth in Widnes, received a £10,000 donation from the rail operator. \nRider and dad-of-two Simon said: “We’re over the moon, We ended 2017 on a high by completing 6,000 jobs which saved the NHS in the region of £250,000. \n“All of our riders and fundraisers are voluntary and give up their time for free so we rely solely on public donations. \n“We always struggle for funding. It costs around £30,000 a year to fund our charity so these generous contributions will make a huge impact to the services we provide.” \nThe charity’s 60 volunteers transport blood, donor breast milk organs and other urgently required medical equipment. \nChemical process worker Simon said: “I got involved because I love motorbikes.I enjoy it a lot, it’s very rewarding.” \nThroughout the year, the blood bikers will be invited to hold bucket collections at Merseyrail stations during major sporting and cultural events including The Grand National, the 10th anniversary of Capital of Culture and Liverpool International Music Festival. \nMerseyrail staff will also raise funds through sponsored challenges. \nMerseyrail managing director Andy Heath said:“If a friend or loved one required an urgent blood transfusion or medical supplies out of hours- most people would assume that there is a service in place that just makes this happen but it’s not that simple. \n“Merseyside and Cheshire Blood Bikes make this possible. They help save our local health authorities thousands of pounds each year by carrying essential bloods and medical items between hospitals out of hours so they don’t have to rely on taxis or other paid for transport. . \n“It is a truly incredible organisation which makes a real difference and is made possible by generous volunteers who sacrifice their own time and work around the clock to provide this essential support service.” \n“We are honoured to have them as our chosen charity for 2018 and will work hard to raise as much money as possible through our fundraising efforts to help such a worthy cause which does so much for the people of Merseyside and Cheshire.”",

        "text": "February 9, 2018 July 26, 1938 ~ February 5, 2018 Norma Faye \"Sally\" Bennett, 79 passed away February 5, 2018 after making the difficult decision to enter hospice care due to her medical conditions. Her sister and children were by her side and the last few weeks were spent with her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, sister, nephews and friends. Sally was born on July 26, 1938 in San Francisco, California to Norman and LaVerne Rabe. She graduated from South San Francisco High School in 1956 and married the love of her life, Carl on November 3, 1956 at St. Teresa of Avila Church in Carson City, Nevada. They moved to Carson City in 1958 and Sally went to work for the PSC for a brief time. She then went to work for the Laxalt family as a legal secretary, first for Paul and then Peter \"Mick\" Laxalt. She remained with Mick as his legaland personal secretary for 36 plus years. In 1997 Sally and Carl sold their home, bought a motorhome and traveled for several years before returning to Carson City in 2004. There was nothing Sally loved more than her children, except for her grandchildren. They truly were the light of her life, and they all loved \"Gramma Sally\" very much. Sally was a wonderful wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother, sister, aunt and friend. Her beautiful smile will be missed by us all. Sally is preceded in death by her parents and her husband Carl. She is survived by her daughters Mechele (Tom), Susan (Keith); son Brian (Joy); grandchildren Christina, Kaitlin, Allen, Patrick, Christian, Sarah; great grandchildren, Madison, Kaydence, Dominic; Sister Sue; nephews Don and Ron; brother Richard and her faithful four legged companion Oliver. We would like to thank the wonderful nurses from CTH Cancer Center, Elizabeth, Angela, Lisa, Jennifer, Caroline and Rhonda; Kindred Hospice; Dr. Nael Abdoul-Hosn, Carmella Downing PA, and Mylea for the love, care and support you have provided to our mother over the years, months and weeks. A funeral mass will be held on Thursday, February 15, 2018 at 11:00am at St. Teresa of Avila Catholic Church, 3000 Lompa Lane, Carson City, Nevada. Reception to follow in Chartz Hall.

I was signed up to be a regular blood donor, and was surprised to discover, when I arrived for the next donation, that the October Red Cross Blood Drive was Jimmy-Buffett-themed. But I had only vaguely heard of Jimmy Buffett, so my boyfriend had to explain the whole thing to me as we were bled into bags prepared by nurses with stuffed parrots and fraying straw hats. I guess he did a good job, because I married him, but we have yet to take much of a beach vacation together.",

        "text": "January 11, 2018 Eric Francis, Getty Images \nWhile working as a librarian at one of the Ohio Department of Corrections' facilities, Andrew Hart received a fair amount of strange book requests. But one, from 2012, stands out in his mind. \n\"I was wondering if you could find a book for me,\" the inmate said. \n“What is it?” Hart asked. \n“I want a book on deboning chickens.\" \nHart paused. “Why would you need that?” \n“I want to be a butcher when I get out.” \n“I was not,” Hart tells Mental Floss, “going to get this guy a book on deboning chickens.” \nThere were other requests: books on getting out of restraints, survival guides, and other titles that would not be appropriate for a population of violent offenders. But for the two years Hart spent working as a prison librarian, the sometimes odd interactions were a small price to pay for helping to facilitate a sense of normalcy in an otherwise isolating and restrictive environment. With their carpeted floors, windows, and computers, prison libraries are one of the few sanctuaries available to inmates—a place that looks and feels like part of the outside world. \n“I think it reminds them of a school library,” Hart says. “It brings them back to their childhood.” \nThe escapism afforded by the books can dilute the urge to pass time by engaging in criminal behavior. Libraries can even prepare prisoners for reentry into society after release, arming them with knowledge to pursue careers. \nThat ambition is what prompts graduates with degrees in library science to take detours—some temporary, others permanent—into managing books behind bars. Like public librarians, Hart organized book clubs, wrangled donations, and set up a shelf full of recommended reading. Unlike his public counterparts, Hart also had to take self-defense courses, check returned books for blood stains, and remain mindful of attempts to manipulate the privileges the library offered. \n“You can be friendly,” he says of his interactions with inmates, “but you can’t be friends.” \n\nBeing allowed the pleasure of reading has been a privilege for prisoners for nearly as long as the idea of criminal detention itself. In the 1700s, religious tomes were handed out with hopes that wayward convicts would find spiritual guidance and correct their behaviors. In the 19th and 20th centuries, an increase in public libraries bled into penal institutions, and scholars advocated for “bibliotherapy,” or rehabilitation through literacy. Inmates devoured texts on psychology and law, increasing their self-awareness and sometimes antagonizing officials by challenging their sentences or their treatment within a facility. \nToday, roughly 1.5 million Americans are incarcerated in federal or state facilities that offer varying degrees of access to literature, from a few shelves full of worn titles to sprawling legal and recreational selections. When Hart decided to put his bachelor’s degree in criminology and master’s in library science to use at the Ohio facility, he was dismayed to find that the unit had only 600 books in its inventory. \n“It was dimly lit and barely had any computers,” he says. “My heart just sank.” \nHart set about improving the library by opening up interlibrary loans—where inmates could request books from public libraries—and “hustling” for book donations from local merchants and other sources. “When you think of a library, you think of books,” he says. “I wanted inmates to come in and see the shelves were full.” \nIn the two years Hart spent at the facility, the library’s inventory grew from 600 books to more than 15,000. When prisoners weren’t after books on deboning animals, they sought out titles on crocheting, affordable living in tiny homes, and what Hart calls “street lit,” a genre of memoirs from reformed criminals. The Japanese graphic novel Naruto was popular; so was the Christian-driven Left Behind series, about the people who remain following the Rapture. John Moore, Getty Images \nAnna Nash, an institutional librarian who oversees multiple facilities for the Institutional Library Services arm of the Washington State Library, says that young adult titles are in demand. “So are paranormal romance titles,” she tells Mental Floss. \nThat prisoners seek out escapist fiction is not so surprising. But for the groups of prisoners who are admitted to the library on a rotating schedule, it’s as much the environment as the content that makes them feel as though they are somewhere else. “The library feels normal,” Nash says. “I had someone who worked in a public library come in as a volunteer one time and she was surprised at how clean everything and everyone looked. It’s a place where prison politics can be quasi-suspended.” \nIf a prison is home to inmates who segregate themselves by race or gang affiliation, the library is a place to congregate. Hart spearheaded book clubs and discussion groups; Nash recently finished a meet-up to discuss George Orwell’s Animal Farm . For one project, Hart solicited recipes from inmates and compiled them into a cookbook that he had custom-printed. For another, he collected art for publication and had the warden of the prison choose his favorite for the cover. He also became a notary so he could help inmates with their legal documents. \n“I think it helped them see me in a different light,” Hart says. \n\nHow inmates see and perceive librarians is often the variable that separates public libraries from prison facilities. “They want to test you, to see how far they can go,” Nash says. \nWhen Nash accepted her first job at a Washington prison library in 2008, friends and relatives were puzzled. “You’re in there with men?” some asked. “With murderers?” \nShe was. And as a staff member, she was expected to exert no less authority than any other employee of the prison. Upon hiring, she underwent a self-defense course in the event an inmate attacked her. She told inmates to tuck in their shirts so that they couldn’t obscure contraband. She admonished them to keep a physical distance from one another. \nNash also avoided answering any personal questions, no matter how innocuous they might seem, like \"What’s your favorite book?\" “They’re trying to test boundaries,\" says says. \"We used the word ‘testing,' which is trying to get a staff member to do something they’re not allowed to do.” An inmate, for example, might want to tear the comics out of the newspaper. If Nash said no, the inmate would argue that another employee had let them do it before.

To get an official to bend the rules is something of a victory for the prisoner, and one that could conceivably result in a breakdown of the supervisor's authority. \nFor Nash, being a woman assigned to a male population posed its own challenges. “When someone walks in and says, ‘Hey, beautiful,’ they know what they’re doing,” she says. “And if you smile back, they think it means something more.” \nHart has heard stories about employees developing inappropriate relationships with inmates. “It can creep in, where you begin bringing in stuff for them,” he says. “You want to be their friend, but you have to maintain that separation.” \nIt’s better to be the one doing the asking. When Nash tries to find out what a prisoner wants so she can make a recommendation, the answer can depend on whether they have a release date in sight. For some, a library isn’t just a release from prison; it’s a way to avoid prison after their release. \n\nAt the age of 20, Eddie Parnell flunked out of community college after less than one semester. Drugs held more sway than an education. “Once I tried meth, that was it for me,” he tells Mental Floss. The descent wasn’t immediate—he could hold down a job while fending off misdemeanor charges—but it was inevitable. At 30, Parnell began the first of what would become three prison stints for drug possession and burglary, the final one stretching for 31 months in Walla Walla, Washington. \nAt Walla Walla, passing time with a television was an expensive proposition. “A TV cost $275 and we made $30 a month working in the kitchen,” Parnell says. “So I would just dig my heels into a good story.” Parnell read Louis L’Amour westerns before growing tired of their repetitive narratives; he segued to Clive Cussler and Stephen King. Some of the paperbacks were so worn that inmates would tape labels from shampoo bottles to try and reinforce their torn covers. \nFor much of his sentence, Parnell read books simply to pass time. But Walla Walla’s educational library—a separate facility from the regular library—promised more. The department had just received a boost from philanthropist Doris Buffett (sister of Warren Buffet) that helped fund a program where inmates could earn an associate’s degree based on the belief that educational funding was sorely lacking when exploring solutions to the issue of recidivism. \nParnell decided he would pursue a degree in molecular bioscience and used all of the resources available to him—including the librarian—to make sure he was stepping into the right environment upon his release. “I couldn’t have done that without access to those resources,” he says. John Moore, Getty Images \nAccording to the National Institute of Justice, two-thirds of released inmates are rearrested within three years, so mired in the cycle of criminal offenses that they see no other alternative. “They say reentry begins at sentencing, but the culture is still a ways off from that,” Nash says. \nEven so, inmates often come in seeking information on how to build opportunities during and after their imprisonment. Some opt to try and learn a trade or how to start a small business. Others take advantage of the reference material in reentry programs to try and cultivate an exit strategy, whether it’s earning a GED or pursuing a degree. Upon his release in 2014, Parnell went the degree route. \n“I graduate in May,” Parnell says. “Instead of being a detriment on society, I’ll be paying taxes. The library system contributed to this.” \n\nFor all of the benefits offered, prison libraries still come up against bureaucratic obstacles. The longest-running one is censorship, or the idea that certain titles aren’t suited for incarcerated populations. \nBut who decides, and why? Recently, New Jersey corrections officials were criticized for taking a book titled The New Jim Crow out of circulation. Published in 2010, the nonfiction work details accusations of racial discrimination in sentencing. Such action is in conflict with a librarian’s support of freedom of speech and publication and the American Library Association’s call to fight censorship as part of its ethical mandates. \n“In Ohio, I called it the ‘banned book list,’ even though a lawyer vehemently told me not to do that,” Hart says. “Usually, it’s when a review team of a librarian, an administrator, a teacher, or someone else finds something objectionable.” The New Jim Crow is certainly a nebulous choice; other titles, like how-tos on weapons-making or combat, are natural omissions. “I couldn’t even get a tai chi book in,” Hart says. \nTitles can be taken out of circulation for reasons other than content. A handful of times, Hart tossed a book he thought had blood stains on it. When he mentioned it to an inmate who worked in the library, the man said that wasn’t likely to happen too often. \n“Why not?” Hart asked. \n“We’re not going to return a book with blood on it,” he said. “We’ll take care of it.” \nAfter two years, a fatigued Hart went on to another state job outside of the prison system. “It was fulfilling but very stressful,” he says, citing long hours and the demands of a job with limited resources. \nLike Nash, who still works with inmates in Washington, Hart still finds tremendous value in making sure offenders have access to the written word. For inmates who choose to take advantage, it can be a life-changing component of doing time. \n“Libraries reduce mental, emotional, and physical conflicts in the prison system,” Parnell says. “If a person is reading a book, they’re not picking a fight in the next cell over. If not for the library, I would be getting ready to go back in.”",

        "text": "February 8, 2018 courtesy One Heartland In 1996, Camp Heartland purchased the 93-acre campus now known as One Heartland in Willow River. The campus has a retreat center, cabins, amphitheater, lakes, pool and more. The facilities are available for rent. For more on the camp, visit www.oneheartland.org. \nDo you remember going to summer camp? It's a tradition full of fond memories for many. Thanks to One Heartland, for the last 25 years, camp has become an option for young people who would never have dreamed of going. \nThat's because One Heartland's summer camps are geared for kids who face stigmatizing circumstances. It is a normal childhood experience for those whose lives are anything but normal. \nThe organization started as Camp Heartland in 1993, a camping experience held throughout the Midwest for youth affected by HIV/AIDS. In 1996, with the help of a donation from Minnesota Twins Manager Paul Molitor, the organization purchased its own 93-acre campus in Willow River. \nIn 2006, the organization expanded its mission and its partnerships, becoming One Heartland. \nWhat has kept its heart beating these 25 years? \nStaff \nA quick perusal of the leadership team on the website shows that, once touched by One Heartland, staff tend to stick around. National Camp Director Jill Rudolph has been with the program for 10 years. Susan Leckey, One Heartland's major gifts officer, has been with the organization since 1993. \nIt's not only staff who want to be there. \n\"It's a place where kids want to be,\" said Tony Koecher of Kerrick, the facility manager for One Heartland. He came on board in May of 2001. \n\"My experience at One Heartland has been very rewarding and continues to this day. I work with a great staff, and kids who need it most,\" Koecher said. He takes care of the grounds, buildings, the mowing and snow plowing, among many other caretaking duties. \n\"I work with hundreds of volunteers every year, some of those volunteers that need to be taught, and some who teach me, and many volunteers who just want to make a difference,\" said Koecher. \nVolunteers \nVolunteers are the lifeblood of the organization. One such volunteer is Jenny Lanoue-Glerum of Moose Lake. A clinical improvement lead for Medica, she looked in the community for volunteer options to make a difference using her nursing skills. \n\"I noticed the camp sign on Highway 61 and decided to research One Heartland to see what volunteer opportunities they needed filled. I volunteered for one week as a nurse at that time during Camp Heartland and have been hooked ever since!\" \n\"I love the mission of the camp and the fact that it is available for so many underserved populations,\" Lanoue-Glerum says of the most meaningful part of volunteering. \"It is an accepting setting that allows the campers to be themselves. Seeing that personal growth that has occurred among campers, other staff, my daughter, and even myself while volunteering, during a week of camp, or from year to year, has been amazing!\" \nShe says there's a bonus. \"The company I work for allows me to use Volunteer Time Off for 16 hours of volunteering, and after I donate 30 hours to an organization, it donates dollars for doers to the organization in my name. Since 2016 I've logged over 435 hours at camp. I truly couldn't imagine a better way to give back!\" \nGroups and individuals can volunteer. \"Camp has great volunteer opportunities for anyone, no matter your age or your skillset,\" says Lanoue-Glerum. \nPartnerships \nOne Heartland partners with many organizations to fulfill its mission. There are several agencies in the Twin Cities that refer young people to camp, such as the housing services People Serving People and Simpson House. \nRudolph explained that much of the work of getting the camp ready for summer is done by a traveling AmeriCorps' National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) group. NCCC teams also serve as camp counselors and have helped restore the camp after flooding caused damage in 2012 and 2016. \nThe Challenge Incarceration Program-Willow River is also a crucial partner, coming weekly to help maintain the facility in any way they can. \nOne Heartland will host a Day of Service this spring, a chance for community members to help prepare camp for the summer - complete with a camp tour and lunch. More information about this opportunity is listed on the organization's website (below). \nDonors \nAccording to the website, the cost of camp is based on income and need, but campers are never turned away if they can't pay, and One Heartland can help cover the cost of transportation. \nThat kind of commitment to kids can only be met by the hearts of generous donors. Though grants are utilized to help cover some expenses, it is through monetary and in-kind gifts both large and small that make camp possible for those families who can't afford it. \nHeart muscle cells are organized in layers that, in coordination, squeeze in different directions to pump blood as efficiently as possible. It is a great picture of the efficiency created when One Heartland staff, partners and donors work together to provide camp for kids. \nThe kids \nLastly, it is seeing courageous young people transformed through the empowerment and hope that a camp experience provides that keeps everyone \"pumped\" and inspired at One Heartland. \nThere's Camp Heartland for those youth living with or affected by HIV/AIDS. Camp Northstar is for youth experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Youth striving for a healthy lifestyle can attend Camp 5210 (5210 is a simple daily formula to live healthier: five or more fruits or vegetables, no more than two hours of screen time, one or more hours of physical activity, and zero sugary beverages). \nCamp True Colors is for youth identifying as LGBTQ+. And Camp Hollywood HEART, hosted in partnership with Hollywood Heart in Malibu, California, helps youth affected by HIV/AIDS through the arts. \nOne testament to the impact of camp is that campers often return to One Heartland for leadership experience and become staff themselves. Some of their stories are shared on the website to celebrate the 25th anniversary milestone. \nGet involved courtesy One Heartland Fishing is a favoritte activity for many campers. \nWhat will help keep this heart going to reach even more young people? The care and support of our community. The public is invited to attend a fundraiser this weekend for One Heartland. Meet staff and volunteers and hear for yourself the impact of camp. \nA \"Party With Heart\" is set for 5-8 p.m. Saturday, February 10, at Moose Lake Brewing Company. There will be beer, brats, baked goods, a silent auction, broomball, live music with the Barstool Revelers and more, all with the goal to raise $5,000 to send 10 kids to camp this summer. For every $6 beer purchased, $2 will go to One Heartland. Details can be shared through their Facebook page. \nTo find out more about One Heartland, to read stories of campers and volunteers, to donate or volunteer, or to register a camper, go to http://www.oneheartland.org/ .

        "text": "The Clackamas Print Once again, the blood drive is back and looking for more donors than ever. The Associated Student Government is teaming up with Bloodworks Northwest to hold the blood drive on Feb. 13 and 14 in Gregory Forum. Anyone over the age of 18, and at least 110 pounds, is eligible to donate blood. BloodWorks Northwest is an independent, nonprofit organization that ASG has teamed up with year after year to save lives. All blood receives immediate, comprehensive testing so that it can be available to more than 90 regional hospitals, usually in less than 24 hours after donation, according to the Bloodworks website. Rachel Morgan, director of community wellness department on campus, said that the nonprofits main goal is to get as many donors as possible. Last term, they had about 50 donors over the two-day period. This term, they said they want to surpass that. Eva Flores, a second-year student at Clackamas Community College, said she has donated blood five times. “I like knowing that the blood is going towards saving other people’s lives.” Below are some tips to keep in mind for anyone planning to participate in the blood drive. According to the Red Cross website, it is important to drink plenty of liquids, wear clothing with sleeves that can be easily rolled up to your elbow, eat iron-rich foods weeks before donating and bring a photo ID before donating blood. “It’s really important for everyone to donate blood if they can,” said Morgan. “It’s such a simple thing to do to help out the community and it has a big impact every time someone donates blood. They can save up to three lives.” According to the Red Cross website, only 10 percent of the population who are eligible to donate blood do so. This, at times, can cause shortages in blood supply, as blood can’t be manufactured. Recently, TIME Magazine reported on a major shortage caused the storms that happened across oregon last year as blood drives were cancelled and shipments went uncollected. The lack of publicity that these events receive can be a major issue when attempting to find potential donors. “I had no idea they were having a blood drive,” said Haley Thompson, a second-year student at CCC. “I’ve never donated blood, but I would if I had the time.” The blood drive will take place in Gregory Forum from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., but will be closed from 12:30-1:30 p.m. Schedule an appointment by visiting the ASG office or by contacting them at (503) 594-3932.

        "text": "By Tim Meeks , Trentonian Friday, February 9, 2018 1:01:52 EST PM Postmedia Network File photo Quinte area residents are being encouraged to give blood at upcoming donor clinics. In particular, people with O-negative blood are being asked to give blood.   \nReport an error \nQuinte area residents are being urged to roll up their sleeves and donate blood, especially O-negative blood.“While all blood types are needed, O-negative blood is in particular demand by hospitals because it is the only type compatible with all other blood types,” said Debbi Barfoot, territory manager for Kingston & Area of Canadian Blood Services. Only about seven per cent of the Canadian population has O-negative blood and the national inventory through Canadian Blood Services is critically low.“I just checked the national inventory this morning (Friday) and there are only two inventory days left for O-negative blood, so that’s concerning.“O-negative blood is used in the most critical situations. When seconds count and somebody’s life is on the line, there’s no time to check their blood type. If there is a 50 car pileup on the 401, all patients are going to receive O-negative blood because there is no time to test blood types. Due to higher than average demand and lower than expected collections, O Negative donors are needed immediately,” Barfoot said. On the Canadian Blood Services website is a section called Mystory where blood donors tell their stories. Only first names are used. Sharon from Belleville, wrote: “Thank you to so many wonderful donors, if it weren’t for them my mother wouldn’t have survived as long as she did. She had Acute Luekemia and sadly passed away Dec.17th/09.“In memory of my wonderful mother I have decided to give back and donate as often as I can, it’s a promise I made to her. She is very missed and forever in our hearts.” Stella, from Trenton, shared her own story, as well.“I’m now on my third blood donation. I used to be terrified of needles - I would cry at the doctor and the thought of getting a cavity filled was a nightmare,” she stated. After joining the Canadian Armed Forces she got over her fear of needles when she required four vaccinations in the same day to catch up because she had spent so long avoiding needles.“I barely even felt them. When I graduated and was given the honour of wearing the uniform, I knew I had to give back by donating blood for the first time in my life. I had so many years to make up for not donating. Since then I have made an appointment at every available opportunity.“My grandmother passed away when I was a teenager but her life was prolonged by blood transfusions. I give blood for me, as a way of giving back to Canada, but also hope that my donation will one day do for someone what those transfusions did for my grandmother and our time together. Thank you, Canadian Blood Services,” Stella wrote. There are several blood donor clinics in the region over the next month, starting Monday at Prince Edward Community Centre in Picton. Loyalist College hosts a clinic Feb. 16 while on Feb. 19 a clinic will be held at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Trenton. On March 5 a clinic will be held at the Belleville Fish and Game Club while on March 13 Campbellford District High School will host a clinic, and on March 24 one will be held at the Calvary Community Church in Belleville.“What many people may not know is that every year, close to 40 per cent of all blood donors stop donating for 12 months or more for a number of reasons. Patients, however, continue to need blood for treatment of various medical conditions. With its limited shelf life, blood is in constant demand.“One in two Canadians is eligible to give blood; however, last year only one in 60 eligible people actually donated,” Barfoot said. The Family Day clinic in Trenton still had 77 open appointments as of this week, so Barfoot is “urging the good residents of Quinte West to come join us at the Knights of Columbus Hall Feb. 19. We want to thank the community for their continued and ongoing support. I hope that existing donors will carry on assisting their neighbours, and I encourage those in the area who have never donated to book their first appointment.” All clinics run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Canadian Blood Services’ clinics operate regular clinics in the Quinte region on a monthly basis and require the support of new donors in the community. Please make an appointment to give blood by downloading the GiveBlood app, calling 1-888 2DONATE (236-6283) or visiting blood.ca. Somewhere, a patient and their family will be thankful.

        "text": "Tyndall registers possible bone marrow donors Friday Feb 9, 2018 at 4:04 PM Feb 9, 2018 at 4:04 PM COLLIN BREAUX News Herald Reporter @PCNHCollinB \nTYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE — Latia Wilkins was happy to give back earlier this week at Tyndall Air Force Base. \nWilkins, an airman at Tyndall, signed up for a bone marrow donation program that ended Friday on base. \n“I’m very compassionate and giving,” Wilkins said. “I think it’s a really wonderful thing to do. You don’t think about it until it happens to you. ... This is my first time registering, so I didn’t know anything about this until now. You can’t put a price on life. I’m excited to do it and I hope I’m a match.” \nDonors who sign up for the C.W. Bill Young Department of Defense Marrow Donor Program are contacted if they’re found to be a strong match. Wilkins and others were encouraging people to sign up Friday when they passed through the Base Exchange. \nThe program allows uniformed and civilian Department of Defense (DoD) personnel, as well as their dependents ages 18-60 to register, according to a post on Tyndall’s Facebook page. \n“Every year about 20,000 Americans are diagnosed with a life-threatening blood disease, something that can only be taken care of by a bone marrow donation,” said Master Sgt. Jason Gilbert, liaison between Tyndall and the program. “The DoD said we have a healthy population of young men and women ready to put themselves in harm’s way to help save lives. This is one extension we can use to be a life-saver for someone.” \nSince the program started in 1991, it has registered more than a million people, 75,000 of which were a probable match, Gilbert said. But out of those 75,000, only 7,000 have been “fully selected” to be a donor after more extensive research. There are no costs or “cut in leave” to the donor, he said. \nAbout 200 individuals have registered this week, Gilbert said. \n“What they do is fill out a contact sheet and health survey. And then they have four cotton swabs. The saliva from the cotton swabs is where the lab up in D.C. will get the human leukocyte antigen, and then it gets put into the registry.” \nThis week’s drive was “a blessing” since airmen are helping save lives, he added. \nShauna Sokolowski, a Tyndall pediatric nurse who urged people to sign up Friday, has firsthand experience with how it feels to participate since she’s donated marrow. \nSokolowski signed up several years ago through Yokota Air Base in Japan and later got a call to donate. Her marrow went to a young girl whose immune system couldn’t fight infections, and though Sokolowski doesn’t know exactly how the girl’s health turned out afterward, she’s confident everything worked out well. \n“For her it would have been a cure,” Sokolowski said. “I assume it would have went well.” Never miss a story \nChoose the plan that's right for you.

        "text": "Close Blood donors answer the call amid flu-driven shortage This was a packed Saturday for the group. Donors helped to fill the state's blood supply after so many regulars, churches and schools have had to sit out because of flu season. Brejamin Perkins , KTHV 7:16 PM. CST February 10, 2018 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nLITTLE ROCK, Ark. (KTHV) - Many Arkansans across the state are still battling with this year’s flu epidemic, affecting donor turnout at the Arkansas Blood Institute. Nearly two weeks ago there was concern about people not coming in, but things are starting to look up. \nThis was a packed Saturday for the group. Donors helped to fill the state's blood supply after so many regulars, churches and schools have had to sit out because of flu season. \n“My blood is C and B negative, so I can give to babies,” said Michael Ragsdale. “A lot of our regular donors have had to cancel because they've had the flu or they're taking care of someone in their family who has the flu,” Executive Director Paulette Nieuwenhof added. \nThe Arkansas Blood Institute put a call out to the community for help and many answered. \n\"I work in the medical field so I know how important it is to give donations,” said Van Maltezo. \nMore than 25 donors spent some of their weekend helping to save lives. \n\"Today is Saturday and we have a full schedule. It's so heartwarming to see our donors come in to donate blood on a rainy day when they could be home,” Nieuwenhof said. \nAlthough the institute is meeting hospital demands right now, keeping blood inventory stocked is still a concern. The group provides blood for all of central Arkansas and 42 hospitals across the state. \n\"I've had the flu, I had it in January. It took me about 30 days to get over it. And I have a friend whose sister died on Tuesday from the flu. There's a lot of sick people out there. I'm sure they need all the blood they can get everyday,” said Ragsdale. \nSome donors give because of personal experiences, while others say it just makes them feel good to know they’re giving back. \n\"I wish more people would donate, but I understand some are squeamish about the needles. The needles aren't the smallest, but after the first stick its really no big deal,” Maltezo said. \nThere are a few requirements if you want to give blood: Be healthy. Be at least 16 years old, weigh 125 pounds and have parental consent. If you're an adult, weight at least 115 pounds.",

        "text": "Welcome to Portland Chapter 1 A legal loophole Chapter 2 Sweeps within 48 hours by the city Chapter 3 'They have nowhere to go' Chapter 4 Views vary on homeless camps Chapter 5 Chapter 1 \nKGW News app users, tap here to view \nPORTLAND, Ore. -- Driving west along I-84 into Portland on a recent morning, overpasses and vegetation obstructed the view at first. \nBut eventually a pair of black and green tents, tied down with ropes and bungee cords, came into plain sight for countless drivers and passengers cruising by, under the NE Halsey overpass. \nPresumably, at least some of them would end up calling Mayor Ted Wheeler’s office to report the camp. \nIt happens a lot. \n“When folks are coming to visit the city of Portland, and they fly into the airport and they drive into downtown, they do so on Highway 84. That’s sort of our welcome red carpet,” said deputy chief of staff Michael Cox. “However, anybody who drives that stretch of road will notice occasionally a lot of trash and debris on the side of the highway or the hills back there.” \nBut the city can’t do anything about those camps. That could change with a proposed state law that would impact the jurisdictional stalemate that has prevented more action. \nPreviously: City may soon have ability to sweep more camps \n“That land is actually not owned by the city of Portland, and therefore we have limited action when it comes to cleaning that up,” he said. \nThat small patch of grass, like most interstate-adjacent properties across the state, is owned and maintained by the Oregon Department of Transportation. Chapter 2 A legal loophole \nPer a 2011 legal settlement, Tucker v. ODOT, ODOT is bound by some of the toughest restrictions of any local governing agency when it comes to clearing possessions, and subsequently people, off its land. \nODOT crews must post a laminated, weather resistant notice in a “conspicuous location within the general vicinity of the campsite”, showing date of the posting, the date of the scheduled clean-up, how long ODOT plans to store the property and a phone number that campers can call to retrieve their property. A homeless camp on ODOT land in Portland, KGW 2018 \nFinally, crews can’t clear campers or their possessions from the property for at least 10-19 days. \nThat’s compared to the city’s 48-hour notice requirements, stipulated by a separate court settlement in 2012. Once ODOT crews do clear a camp on their property, the slate is wiped clean. Campers can come back, even hours later. \nIf and when they do, the process starts over. \nA spokesman for ODOT said Thursday the agency performs 200-300 sweeps a year. \n“Yeah, you want to stay on ODOT land because it’s like it’s not criminal. You know what I mean,” said Caleb “Alabama”, a man camping on ODOT property near Southeast 92nd and Division. \nIt’s a piece of land marked by one of ODOT’s permanent signs that reads ‘No Trespassing’. Campers had set up two large tents less than 50 feet away. \n“You can’t really shut the area down,” he said. Chapter 3 Sweeps within 48 hours by the city \nDuring the current legislative session, scheduled to end March 11, the city and ODOT are looking to drastically narrow the timing loophole created by those two settlements. \nIf passed, House Bill 4054 would allow ODOT to enter into an intergovernmental agreement with any city, such as Portland, with a population larger than 500,000 people. \nUnder that agreement, city crews could then take over clearing property, including that of homeless campers, from land owned and maintained by ODOT. \nIn Portland’s case, it means the city could collect and monitor clean-up requests concerning ODOT land via the city’s One Point of Contact app and notify social service agencies who work with the city and Multnomah County via their joint Office of Homeless Services that a clean-up is imminent. \nIt also means they could carry out those requests under the city’s shorter 48-hour timeline. Clearing a homeless camp on ODOT property, KGW, 2018 \n“ODOT is responsible as an agency for maintaining highways across the state. They are not a homeless services agency. The city of Portland, however, in partnership with the County and service providers, does this work every day,” said Michael Cox of the Mayor’s office. \n“What we want to do is create some consistency and improve the collaboration between our agency and the state agencies to make sure we can do what the people of Portland expect which is to keep our city clean, to keep our city safe and to care for our most vulnerable citizens.” \nOn Wednesday morning, Marc Jolin, director of the Joint Office of Homeless Services, testified at a hearing on the bill in front of the House Committee on Transportation Policy. \nHis testimony largely echoed Cox’s support. \n“Portland’s current approach and the one the city would use if entered into an [intergovernmental agreement] with ODOT has a number of important benefits,” he said. “This is an extremely transparent system… This transparency heads off misunderstandings and builds both trust and accountability.” \nJolin talked about weekly conference calls that include representatives from Mayor Ted Wheeler’s office, Multnomah County, law enforcement agencies, social service providers and other organizations. \n“These calls and the relationships that have formed through them have helped mitigate the impacts of clean-ups on campers, frequently connecting them with vital services,” he said. “There’s also a level of coordination between public safety and social services around the people impacted by clean-ups that I have not experienced before.” Chapter 4 'They have nowhere to go' \nThat said, not everyone at the hearing championed the bill. \nA representative from the Oregon Law Center, the organization who brought the policy-changing suits against both ODOT and the city of Portland years ago, also spoke at Wednesday’s hearing. \n“We think that camps are one way that neighbors who are houseless can protect themselves and create some community and provide some greater stability for themselves, and so we are very concerned about any disruption of that community and that safety,” said Sybil Hebb, director of legislative advocacy at the Oregon Law Center. \nHebb added during her testimony, though, that the agency is “neutral” on the bill, adding, “We understand that there are competing needs that the city and ODOT are trying to manage with respect to… neighborhoods and also our neighbors who are houseless.” \nKimberly McCullough, policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon, spoke immediately after Hebb. \nShe started her testimony by stating that the organization is also “neutral” on the bill, but her testimony was more pointed. \n“What we are talking about is a situation where ultimately people are swept from spaces that they convene with each other,” she said. “They have nowhere to go. They’re moved from place to place to place. Each time they’re moved, they lose more of their belongings… Being broken up in that way creates an intense lack of safety because of the isolation.” \n“There is still a lot of deep discrimination in our society where homeless people are blamed for the circumstances they are in,” she said. “The reason that people are homeless is because there is a lack of affordable housing.” \nNeither Hebb nor McCullough made any mention of potential legal challenges to the bill, if passed. \nMichael Cox Thursday said staff with the Mayor’s office are confident that the strategy of applying the city’s timeline to state controlled land. \n“We certainly have an eye to the legalities and feel like this is something that we can do, if it’s done right,” he said. “This is a priority for the city.” Chapter 5 Views vary on homeless camps \nIn Southeast Portland, a homeless man named Caleb said he had not heard of the bill that would allow the city to clear his camp within two days. \nThere’s a stretch of homes nearby, one of which belongs to Donna, a woman who’s contacted KGW multiple times for help clearing campers who, she said, threatened and harassed her. \nCaleb said he felt bad for homeowners who are nervous watching camps form near their property, but he pointed out his camp serves a purpose. \nWomen follow the bike path down below to this camp, he said, looking for protection from abuse and assault. Breaking them up would send already traumatized people back into a life of solitude and vulnerability. \n“We’ve got a few college degrees, a couple vets up there and stuff like that. They’re good people. A lot of these are just young people doing their thing,” he said. “Give them a little direction.” \nAcross town, Thursday morning, that small camp perched above I-84 appeared to be empty. Tents were zipped up, belongings were packed away and all was quiet. \nAcross the street, staff at The ARC of Multnomah-Clackamas, a non-profit that serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, were relieved amid the peace and quiet. \n“It’s getting out of control,” said Francesca Rosborough, an administrative assistant. \nRosborough was alone inside the organization’s office and donation center one Friday morning a few weeks back, when a man walked in. Sign at donation center for ARC of Multnomah-Clackamas, KGW 2018 \nShe believes he came from the camp across the street. He was aggressive and approached her, demanding a free bike. \n“He just came right next to my chair where I was sitting at my desk,” she said. “He just threatened me and said ‘Well, it’s just better that you give me the bike. Otherwise I will have to steal it.’” Donation center for ARC of Multnomah-Clackamas, KGW 2018 \nRosborough said it was at that moment that a male coworker walked in, prompting the man to run off. She and her boss Dee Wright called the Portland Police non-emergency line. \nFor Wright, hearing her employee’s safety put at risk was the last straw. \n“I don’t care whose land it is. They need to come clean it up… We’ve had needles, blood, everything out here,” she said. “But again, they cleaned it up and they’ll be back in a couple days. So they need to figure out a long-term solution.” \nDiscuss this story and Portland's homeless crisis by following reporter Maggie Vespa on Facebook © 2018 KGW ",

Waweru died of Leukemia in 2016. [David Njaaga, Standard] \nAs the world marked cancer awareness this week, Getrude Lusia from Kawangware, Nairobi, was lost in thought. \nShe was reminded of the many nights she stayed awake in her single roomed house, watching her son’s heartbeat, and praying he makes it. \nALSO READ: Prioritise cancer management in public hospitals \nHer son, Granious Waweru, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2016. He was six years old. \nRetracing the moments after the doctor gave her the results, to the day she watched her son die exactly one year ago, Lusia says when poverty mixes up with cancer, the result is loss of faith in humanity, and death. \n“I will never forget the evening I threw myself on the ground and wept like a baby at the hospital reception hall. I had my son on my back, and was told I can only be admitted if I had Sh40,000. I started losing faith in everything, including God,” says Lusia. \nHer story and appeal for help to save her son was so intense, Kenyans reached out with blood and monetary donations to help save her son. \n“Help came too late. I lost Waweru two days after so many people came forward to help,” she says. \nHer struggle -- carrying her son to hospital every day because they could not afford ambulance services, moving around hospitals to get a diagnosis, and making personal appeals for help -- is one that most poor households are familiar with. \nCatherine Nyongesa, the chief executive of Texas Cancer Centre in Nairobi, says interventions always come a bit too late for children from poor homes. \n“They go round seeking a diagnosis. When they finally get it, the condition is often in the late stages, making it difficult to manage,” she says. \nALSO READ: Kibera woman feeds 37 children all on her own \nDr Nyongesa told Saturday Standard of a case last week when a mother walked in with a very sick child; and nothing in her pocket. All they needed was a doctor. \nEven though they were admitted, the cancer was so wide spread. In less than a week, the child died. \nStephen Kuria from Kariobangi says he always walks with the book that changed his life. One he was given at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) when his son Peter Njoroge was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. \nWhen he flips it open, the words ‘embroyonal rhabdomysaracoma’ run across the page. The rare form of cancer that fell little Peter. He was five. \nHelpless \nKuria says from the day those words were written, to the day his son died, he learnt that when you do not have money, and your child is diagnosed with cancer, your dignity goes too. “That state of helplessness, not knowing what to do is the worst feeling. No parent should ever go through that,” says Kuria. \nRhoda Wairimu, mother of three-year-old Leon Aywa who succumbed to non hogins lymphoma (cancer affecting immune system) at Mukuru kwa Ruben last year, says an early diagnosis could have saved her son. \nALSO READ: When cancer shook the world of football \n“It took us a long time, trying different dispensaries in Mukuru. By the time they saw it, my boy was too sick,” she says. \nWairimu holds on to the barely used books etched with shaky letter formation of how Leon was beginning to learn how to write the alphabet – a reminder of an interrupted life. \nIrene Juma, who has championed many fund raising events for children with cancer, says lack of comprehensive insurance for the slum dwellers, and the fact that the parents are always out, makes it easy for them to miss the early signs of development of the disease.

        "text": "0 843 Rivers State Governor, Chief Nyesom Wike (right), his Benue State counterpart, Samuel Ortom (2nd right) and other leaders at the graveside of 73 victims of Fulani herdsmen invasion during the Rivers State Governor's condolence visit with Rivers Elders to Benue State, last Wednesday. \nThe Rivers State Governor, Chief Nyesom Wike has called for immediate and comprehensive measures to resolve the unfortunate killing of Benue people by Fulani herdsmen. The governor donated N200million to the Benue State Government for the purchase of relief materials and medicines for the displaced persons. Wike declared that it was no longer fashionable to trade blames while innocent people were killed by armed gangs. Wike spoke at the Peoples’ House in Makurdi, last Wednesday, after he led a delegation of Rivers Elders on a condolence visit to Benue State in honour of those killed by Fulani herdsmen earlier this year in the state. Wike and Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom led other leaders to offer prayers at the graveside of the 73 Benue people murdered in cold blood. He said: “What has happened in Benue State has affected me. I am pained. Look at deaths everywhere. Nobody is free again. “People don’t understand the magnitude of the injury inflicted on the people of Benue State. The country must sit down to proffer solutions to this menace”. The governor said the conflict that affects a component state affects the entire country as it dislodges the security system. “There is no way anybody can justify these killings. There is no justification whatsoever. The people of Benue State must rally round their governor at this point”, he said. The governor added: “When you have a brother who has problems, you associate with him. Time has come when we must rise above party lines and tackle our problems”. Wike said as Christians, Rivers people respect the sanctity of human lives, hence the visit to Benue State. He urged the Benue people to be vigilant at all times and employ techniques of self-defence to protect themselves from unprovoked attacks. At the graveside of the slain 73 persons, Senator George Sekibo offered prayers for the repose of their souls. In his remarks, Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom said that 100,000 persons have been displaced by the invasion of Fulani herdsmen. Ortom said that Benue State was also battling with the influx of displaced persons from Cameroun. The Benue State governor regretted that rather than resolve the security challenges facing the state, the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris has become a spokesman for the Fulani herdsmen. The killers of Benue people are known to the security agencies. He said the people of Benue State will continue to seek for justice until the leaders of Miyetti Cattle Breeders are arrested. Ortom thanked the government and people of Rivers State for the donation, saying that they have acted as true brothers. The Benue State governor added that the graveyard for the 73 persons was set up as a memorial for those killed by Fulani herdsmen. Wike was accompanied by former Rivers State Governor, Sir Celestine Omehia, Senator George Sekibo, Senator Olaka Nwogu, former Minister of Sports, Dr Tammy Danagogo, former Minister of Transport, Dr Abiye Sekibo, Chairman of Greater Port Harcourt City Development Authority, Chief Ferdinand Anabrabra, former National President of NBA, Chief Onueze Okocha, Prince Emma Anyanwu and former Attorney General of Rivers State, Hon Frank Owhor. Meanwhile, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has commended the Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike and his Ekiti State counterpart, Ayo Fayose, for visiting Benue state and extending assistance to victims of the recent violent attacks and other internally displaced persons in the state. The party leadership, which had earlier visited Benue State in the wake of the attacks, said the gesture by the two governors at a time the Presidency and governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) turned a blind eye to the sufferings of the victims, underlines PDP’s commitment to the wellbeing of all Nigerians in line with its ideology. National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement yesterday, said it is disheartening that the Presidency had refused to visit Benue State recalling that when the APC governors visited, after much entreaties, they failed to show any form of empathy to the victims. The party said that instead of APC empathizing with the people and ensuring that perpetrators of the attacks were brought to book, “ the party leaders have shown more concern for their selfish political interests across the nation.” “I charge the federal government to stop ruling Nigeria with a double standard. Killing innocent souls, sacking their communities is nothing but terrorism. The Nigerian constitution has given you the powers to make law. You have made the anti-open grazing law, stand by it. The law must not be compromised or aborted.” Governor Fayose also charged his Benue State counterpart to reconsider his affiliation to the ruling party saying, “if the vehicle you are using can no lower carry you, change that vehicle.” Responding, Governor Ortom, while thanking his Ekiti State counterpart and his entourage for the visit, regretted that the authorities did not heed his earlier alerts from Benue which could have saved those who were killed in the attacks. In the words of Governor Ortom, “Yes, we are mourning, we are grieved by the actions of these killers but if those who are responsible for providing security had heeded our alarm, those people may not have been killed.

        "text": "Don't start no shit won't be no shit The Five Most M OW HISS Moments In This Week’s House Intelligence Committee Hearing   This is Adam Schiff’s OH NO YOU DI’INT face probably. \nRemember when THE MEMO was released last Friday and immediately the whole entire US and A and several small island nations started LMAO-ing so hard they caused a LOL-quake that was felt in China? That was fun! \nOn Monday, the House Intelligence Committee (HPSCI) held a hearing to vote on releasing the Democratic response memo, the one that takes a big red pen to the Republican memo and shows which parts are bullshit (all of it), according to not only the Democrats, but also the FBI and the Department of Justice. They voted that yes, it should be released, for transparency! And they released the transcript of their hearing today, for super transparency! \nAnd now, the Democratic memo is sitting on the Resolute Desk, underneath all the other documents (Trump loves documents!) and Big Mac wrappers (Trump loves Big Macs!). Has Trump read it? Hahahahahaha, OK so the trouble, according to John Kelly, is that the Democratic memo is AS LONG AS TWO BIBLES (it is ten pages) and that’s too long for Trump to read. Anyway, Trump will get around to letting the Democratic memo out without redacting all the parts that make him look like a fucking idiot VERY SOON, you bet! (The deadline is today.) \nWe are not live-blogging you the whole transcript of Monday’s hearing, because girl it is Friday, so just no. But suffice it to say that oh man, the Democrats and Republicans on this committee hate each other, and oh man, we absolutely must take back the House in November, as in that is the bare minimum we must accomplish, because this is no way to run a country. \nHere are five of the most ME WWWW HISS moments in the hearing transcript, accompanied by moving cat pictures: \nIn this section, GOP idiot Peter King says UH HUH the DODGY DOSSIER has been disproven, because Trump asshole lawyer Michael Cohen says he wasn’t in Prague meeting with Russian agents when the DODGY DOSSIER said he was. In response Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell is like “Cool story, bro. I fuckin’ DARE Y’ALL to subpoena his records, instead of just taking his word for it.” \nUH HUH! \nAnd here is GOP idiot Mike Turner of Ohio, who is not usually so mouthy, who is OBSESSED with how the Devin Nunes memo PROVED that Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded the work that led to the production of the DODGY DOSSIER. Of course, the Democrats and everybody else in the world are like, “Babydoll, everybody knows that. Stop saying it over and over again IN ALL CAPS WITH EXCLAMATION POINTS, because what you are saying is meaningless.” They make Republicans mighty stupid up there in Ohio. \nAnyway, Turner gets why the DUMBO-CRAPS are mad and want to subpoena Michael Cohen’s shit, because they must be real DEM-BARRASSED about how Hillary Clinton and the DNC funded Chris Steele’s investigation, which we just now learned many months ago: \nPerhaps Rep. Turner should go back to shutting the fuck up. \nADAM SCHIFF: Why are you fucking idiots talking about Michael Cohen anyway? \nGOP IDIOT PETER KING: Dossier! Dodgy dossier! \nSCHIFF: But your stupid memo was about how the FISA court somehow improperly approved multiple FISA warrants against Carter Page The Literal Actual Russian Intelligence Asset, because dossier information was included amongst MULTITUDES OF OTHER INTELLIGENCE in that FISA application. \nKING: Dossier! Dodgy dossier! \nSCHIFF: Jesus Christ. \nKING: Reclaiming my time! reclaiming my time! Adam Schiff just made me look like A Idiot! That means I get my time back! Reclaiming my time! \n\nMIKE TURNER: Can I interrupt Eric Swalwell a lot? \nSWALWELL: Yeah, once I’m done talking about ALL THE FUCKING TRUMP-RUSSIA CONSPIRACIES we have solid evidence of, and about how the Republicans flat-out lied in their dumb memo. \nTURNER: Can I interrupt Eric Swalwell a whole bunch more? \nSWALWELL: Eat me. \nTURNER: I can’t eat you unless you let me interrupt you, with my mouth. \nSWALWELL: I’m still talking, asshole. \nTURNER: Will you stop talking if I interrupt you again? \n(This is a long one, but get ready, because Swalwell is very good here.) \n\nMIKE TURNER: Can I interrupt Joaquin Castro too? \nJOAQUIN CASTRO: Pound sand, motherfucker! \nJesus Christ! \nBy the way, the question was whether Devin Nunes would FINALLY answer whether or not he wrote his dumb little memo with the White House, or if they wrote it for him, or told him what to say. At the very end, Nunes finally said, “there was no involvement in drafting the memo with the White House,” because we guess it took him a whole week to figure out how to answer that question with a technically true answer. \nBy the way, here is a picture of Mike Turner, who is your new favorite Republican idiot on the intel committee: \nWant a bonus MEOW HISS moment? OK fine, here is your boyfriend Adam Schiff, being extraordinarily CATTY to Devin Nunes: \nDAMN GIRL DAMN! \nOK it is your open thread now, you earned it. \nFollow Evan Hurst on Twitter RIGHT HERE. http://wonkette.com Evan Hurst is the Senior Editor of Wonkette. He spends his days deflecting the sad glances of his black lab, Lula, who would please like him to stop typing letters to the internet and throw the squeaky chicken in the backyard instead. Though the internet does not give him credit, it's probably his fault Aaron Schock is no longer a congressperson, due how Evan would not stay off his tail during the SCANDALS. (Not in a sex way, in a writing way!) Also, he writes songs and plays the piano, at the same time! Lastly, Evan is a Southern person, and thus is casting polite judgment on you, right now, for reading this. Bless your heart. \nThey certainly can’t do any worse than the Republicans. Blackest Noobs \nespecially in fucking Kansas, jesus what a shithole! BadKitty904 \nWhat’s left of it. Charles Insandiego \nI heard about this on Preet Bhahara’s Podcast, which is worth a listen-to. Lord Jim \nEthan Randleas, a high school senior and libertarian candidate for the office, wrote on his website’s “About Me” section, “I am running to shake up Topeka, breaking up the stranglehold of statism that has began to cast its dark shadow over our great state.” He added, “I may be young, but that does not mean that I am incapable of serving the people of Kansas.” \nstranglehold of statism that has began to cast its dark shadow over our great state \nlolwut? \nSomebody just finished their first reading of “Atlas Derp”. armed_bears \n== people who tell him he’s awesome. everstar \nA different relationship, like “plaintiff vs defendant”. Cousin Itt, hoi polloi \nOh, that’s just guy lockeruproom talk. (((fka_donnie_d))), SOB \nThe problem with Archie Bunker was that he humanized this bullshit. In hindsight, probably a bad idea BadKitty904 \nLet me just say that Republican Cat (that’s how I have that first gif filed in the monumental BadKitty Cat Archives) is the only Republican I love. clairence \nWhy must you separate America from the United States? Cousin Itt, hoi polloi \nGreat, now Dok is channeling Samuel Beckett⸮ Anna Rompage \nIf Trump relies on Faux & Fiends reports for his intelligence briefings and bases our national policies off of them, then why the hell isn’t the dodgy dossier taken more seriously by the majority… \nBut I digress \nLooks like brolly bunny’s multiplied. Of course, that’s what they do. Bill D. Burger \nOh my! 3rd in charge, Deputy AG Rachael Brand, announces she’s leaving the DOJ___after only 9 months on the job. \nHmmmm! \nuh oh. whoever takes the job will be the one to fire Mueller, right? Bill D. Burger \nEverything is up in the air at the moment. Crazee’ time in a Crazee’ FUBAR administration. CripesAmighty \nOnce Rosenstein is out of the way. UncleTravelingMatt \nI dunno. Quick check says she was part of W’s legal team during the recount, oversaw Alito’s appointment, and is absolutely dead into violating people’s civil rights for the sake of intelligence gathering. Oh, and she was a senior fellow at the Heritage Institute. “Clown Show” appears to be her milieu. CripesAmighty \nRuh-roh. Slo-Mo Saturday Night Massacre continues apace: Rachel Brand just bailed, leaving an opening for Dump to install a stooge who rises to the top of the toilet bowl when he flushes Sessions and Rosenstein. Shawn Charniga \nA position that high up will likely be subject to Senate confirmation. 51-49. Someone will flip. BadKitty904 \nI love when Evan lets his Southern show and calls people “Babydoll”… Crystalclear12 \n“Honey” is also acceptable if said with insincere pity. BadKitty904 \nAs someone who regularly addresses friends and strangers – much to my husband’s amusement – as “Sugar,”“Heart,”“Angel,” etc., I’m with Evan. Ms. MLG on Maui \nSame. It tickles people here on Maui. In the South, it’s common practice. BadKitty904 \nYou don’t even think about it. My husband was startled the first time my uncle – former Army Col. etc. – addressed him as “honey”… The Wanderer \nOT:. Rachel Brand is leaving the DOJ. I’m thinking that this is because Trump wants to fire Sessions and Rosenstein so he can ditch Mueller, and Brand left in order to stimey him. Lord Jim \nSwalwell and Schiff come from the Barack Obama school of verbal destruction – articulate, measured, but pointed. BadKitty904 \nI’m surprised the Repugs didn’t lodge an “Unfair Use of Braininess” protest. calliecallie \nhttps://youtu.be/AvBj0QNdjpU?t=69 UncleTravelingMatt \nI love pointing out to the Missus that even though she has been insured by the same company for nearly 20 years, and even though my existence has only been known to them since we bought a car a year ago, Farm Bureau still lists my name first in all correspondence. It drives her into an absolute rage. Joe Beese \nThe pleasure in deliberately irritating one’s significant other is one of the joys of domesticity. \nI can always annoy Mrs. Beese with a deadpan delivery of something incredibly obvious or trite. For example, if she mourns the elimination of a particular contestant on Top Chef , I’ll say in a tone of serious analysis, “At this level of the competition, the slightest mistake can send you home.” \nNever fails. \nIs this what precedes make-up sex for the olds? ;-) Magma Cardhole jesterpunk \nKING: Reclaiming my time! reclaiming my time!

Also, too, Trump says he is going to release the Dem memo, according to CNN: At the end of President Trump’s unexpected pool spray, the President was asked if he plans to release the Democratic memo.“It’s gonna be released soon,” Trump said. The memo is the Democratic rebuttal to the controversial GOP-Nunes memo, which was released last week and alleges the FBI abused its surveillance tool. The House intelligence Committee voted to release the Democratic memo on Monday, but the President must decide whether to allow the document to be made public or object to its release. puredog \nLike, maybe, two weeks or so, I’m guessing? cmd resistor \nWell, if they are waiting for him to actually read it and color in the margins with his crayons…… Rebel Scum with permit \nIt will be released soon.

The White House is denying chief of staff John Kelly has offered to resign. \n“He has not offered to resign,” spokesman Hogan Gidley told CNN. \nThe White House statement comes as Kelly and other top administration officials are facing questions about why they did not act to remove deputy chief of staff Rob Porter from his position after they found out about allegations that Porter struck his two-ex-wives while they were married. \nOh, I think there’s plenty already, thanks… bluicebank \nNever mind.

When I’m knitting on the train or during lunch or something and someone asks me who its for, I’ll be honest and say me. Then they always look a bit taken aback by that. Fuck that, I’ll make someone a scarf or head warmer, but if I’m investing the time in a sweater or blanket its for me. Angela Ruzzo \nTheir reaction might be due to having a mother like mine, who obsessively knit incredibly ugly sweaters for all her children and grandchildren that we hated to wear, so they can’t imagine that someone would knit anything for themselves. Angela Ruzzo \n“She is not the one I am worried about in this room” HOLY SHIT I laughed so hard I scared the cats. \nSpeaking of cats, I got some bad news today. I have posted several times in the past 2 weeks about my Older Cat (her name is Isabelle) who has been throwing up several times a day for the past 3 weeks. I tried very expensive organic cat food, this worked for a week, then it stopped working. I then took her to the vet who prescribed very expensive hairball medication. This worked for 4 days, then it stopped working. So yesterday I bit the bullet and spent $360 I don’t have for blood tests and an x-ray. The bad news is that Isabelle has bladder stones – several of them, and they are large. \nI never even heard of bladder stones before. They are causing painful urination, and she spends half her time licking her anus, after which she obsessively washes herself, which along with the bacteria and blood building up in her bladder is producing the vomiting. She isn’t eating or drinking much and has lost 1/4 pound in the past week. She isn’t going to die immediately, but she needs surgery. \nThe problem is the surgery will cost an additional $700 that I do not have. I contacted at least 25 animal charities by phone or email today, but half of them only help dogs, and the other half say they only provide financial assistance in cases of immediate life-threatening illness, which they say Isabelle does not qualify for because technically she could live quite a while with this condition before she drops dead in agonizing pain, during which time I could try to raise the money myself. Technically, this is true. There is also a network of veterinarians who will provide low cost medical care if the human qualifies, but not one of the vets within 120 miles of my town participates in this network. I even called the local Vet School, but they charge as much as the private vet does and I have had bad experiences with them previously, so no help there. \nSo if any of you have $5 or $10 to spare, I have set up a GoFundMe account to Save Isabelle. The surgery is scheduled for Feb. 23. Any little bit will help, so thank you in advance. \nJeeze, I hate asking people for money. I wouldn’t do it for myself for any reason whatsoever, I would rather curl up and die, but I will do it for Isabelle. shastakoala \nI’m so sorry. Have you tried any rescue organizations? Angela Ruzzo \nYes I have, and they have no money for anything other than urgent emergencies, and all they could offer was free euthanasia. Since I saved Isabelle from euthanasia 8 years ago, this is not an attractive option. Lord Jim \nSmall donation and prayers coming your way. TJ Barke \nCan you qualify for carecredit? Angela Ruzzo \nI hate to say this, but the one thing I hate more than asking for money is using credit. It has taken me 12 years to recover from losing everything I own in a hurricane and incurring debts, and I really, really don’t want to go that route unless I absolutely have to. TJ Barke \nYou can get interest free for like 12 months. janecita \nhttps://www.youcaring.com/blog/2016/need-help-with-vet-bills Marion in Savannah \nI chipped in (wish it could have been more) and posted to my FaceBorg page, which I don’t think I’ve posted to in, like, forever. But there are a lot of cat lovers out there who have “friended” me, so fingers crossed. Fire and Fury Demme \n(Our humane society is run by cat people that would love to help.) Tiffany de Houston \nI just made a small donation, Angela. Good luck to both you and Isabelle. She’s a beautiful kitty. JMP \nMy cat runs off whenever Trump starts speaking on the TV, too; she cannot stand that voice. Edith Prickly, Stable Genius \nNeither can I – I’m still mystified at how anyone sat through his garbage reality show (the one from the last decade, not the current one.) Rebel Scum with permit \nHis voice is awful. When you combine it with his face it’s the worst. There’s something about that little circle he makes with his fingers that makes me want to throw something. cmd resistor \nI am happy to say I never saw a minute of it. Edith Prickly, Stable Genius \nMe neither. Why the fuck would anyone watch Drumpf if they didn’t have to? Parakeetist \nMy Mom, who is 76, screams “Motherfucker!” when Trump is on. I’m proud of her.

        "text": "Home » Blood Drive scheduled for Monday Blood Drive scheduled for Monday   \nThe flu epidemic affecting Arkansas is negatively impacting the blood supply. Because so many of our regular donors are ill, or taking care of sick family members, they’ve been unable to give blood. Additionally, the widespread flu is forcing some school closures, and parents are unable to keep their blood donation appointments. All of this puts even more strain on the blood supply. Arkansas Blood Institute is urging all healthy adults, ages 16 and up*, to give blood. Blood donors who have been diagnosed with flu should wait seven days since their last symptoms to give blood. Donors may give blood the same day they receive a flu vaccine. Arkansas Blood Institute will be holding a blood drive on Monday, February 12 at the Malvern Walmart from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Refreshments always served. All Arkansas Blood Institute blood donors will receive their choice of a new, trendy T-shirt in one of three featured colors, “Strong” olive, “Bold” maroon, or “Fearless” teal. Donors will also receive an admission to the Museum of Discovery, free health screening and learn their blood type. “The flu has hit our state particularly hard, but the need for blood remains constant, and there is no substitute,” said John Armitage, M.D., president and CEO of Arkansas Blood Institute. “That’s why we are calling on all donors who are able to give blood, or those who have never given before, to stop by one of our donor centers or mobile blood drives. If you have recovered from the flu, or been unaffected by it, we urge you to use your good health to save lives today.” Only ten percent of people in the United States who are eligible to give blood actually do. Blood donation takes only about an hour, and each donation can save the lives of up to three patients. As part of the nation’s 9th largest non-profit blood center, Arkansas Blood Institute serves more than 40 hospitals and medical facilities statewide. Appointments to give blood aren’t required but can be made by calling (877) 340.8777 or visiting arkbi.org. *16-year-olds must weigh at least 125 pounds and provide signed parental permission; 17-year-olds must weigh at least 125 pounds; 18+ year-olds must weigh at least 110 pounds Tags:",
